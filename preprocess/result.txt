EVALUATION\nWe have implemented a prototype of Luori and deployed it from November 2023 to April 2024. In this section, we evaluate the performance of Luori during its deployment.\nA. Experimental Setup\n1) Seed Datasets: To evaluate the performance of Luori, we first obtained an Internet-wide total of 211,037 announced IPv6 routing prefixes from the RouteViews project [24] and CAIDA [27]. The initial FRP detection for these prefixes by APD reveals 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the target prefixes to be probed are 205,735. Further, we select the latest FRPlist (May 4, 2023) provided by a well-known IPv6 hitlist service [12], [14], [15] as the dataset, which contains 5.1M FRPs and comes from active address probing. However, it is just 1.03M after taking the largest. Meanwhile, 4,703 of them belong to known 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the final seed dataset contains 1.02M FRPs covering 1858 target prefixes (i.e., seeded prefixes), and thus the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877.\n2) Evaluation Metrics: We design the following three met- rics to fully evaluate the performance of Luori: (1) Address space (i.e., number of addresses) covered by the probed largest FRPs. (SFRP). (2) Number of ASes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NAS). (3) Number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NRP ). The goal of FRP probing is to discover as many of the largest FRPs as possible among a certainB,i.e.,SFRP islarge.Additionally,itisalsoimportant to cover as wide a range of the Internet as possible, i.e., more NAS and NRP , to reflect the potential for probing FRP across the entire Internet.

The primary purpose of the Luori probing method for IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) is to efficiently discover and evaluate FRPs in IPv6 networks. Luori contributes significantly to the FRPlist by probing for FRPs of arbitrary length, enhancing its coverage and accuracy ([0][2][3]). The method is designed to be an effective tool for active address probing, which helps in identifying and analyzing the presence and characteristics of FRPs across the IPv6 Internet. By collecting comprehensive data on FRPs, Luori aids in understanding the performance and behavior of IPv6 networks, as well as in developing strategies for their optimization and deployment.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

The primary purpose of the Luori probing method for IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) is to actively discover and probe IPv6 FRPs across the entire Internet. Luori, as described in the data, is an organization or method that efficiently probes arbitrary routing prefixes using reinforcement learning ([1]). This active probing method is designed to enhance the coverage and accuracy of the FRPlist, which is a crucial resource for network measurements and analysis ([0], [2]).\n\nLuori's approach stands out by its ability to probe FRPs of arbitrary length, which is a significant advantage over other methods like MAPD. MAPD, for instance, focuses on IPv6 active address probing, detecting prefixes smaller than /64 and containing more than 100 active addresses under them ([2]). Luori's capability to find larger FRPs and its efficiency in probing suggest that it is particularly useful for Internet-wide IPv6 FRP discovery and measurement campaigns ([7], [12]).\n\nThe effectiveness of Luori is further highlighted by its comparison to other methods such as MAPD. Luori outperforms MAPD in terms of the number of SFRP and NAS, indicating superior performance in probing FRPs ([5]). This makes Luori a valuable tool for organizations and researchers seeking to understand the current status and impact of Fully Responsive Prefixes across the IPv6 Internet ([11]).

FRPlist and Hitlist’s FRPlist. For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze these FRPs we probed and to verify their authenticity, we have sent emails to network managers of 280 different ASes (mailboxes are accessible and contain more FRPs). As of now, we have only received responses from 7 ASes, one of which was not aware of such prefixes. But they both confirm that the FRPs we probed are correct. Specifically, in one AS (not belonging to Cloudflare), FRPs were reported to be an implementation of a certain CDN technology, and each FRP does not correspond to the same host, but the details were not provided. Furthermore, in five ASes, FRPs were reported to be implemented based on existing functionality of the Linux system, and each FRP corresponds to the same host. The mentioned implementation methods are as follows: (1) net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind. It is a configuration option in the Linux kernel that controls the binding of IPv6 addresses. When set to 1, it allows binding to non-local IPv6 addresses, i.e. FRPs are implemented. (2) ip -6 route add local PREFIX dev IFACE. This is a command to add an IPv6 local route on a Linux system for a specific IPv6 prefix on a network interface (IFACE). In addition, we investigated that the IP FREEBIND option in Linux also enables multiple IPv6 addresses to be bound to the same host [14]. Moreover, they also share usage scenarios for these FRPs, including: (1) Spreading requests over many IP addresses to address IP-based rate limiting in large systems. (2) FRPs used as proxy services (e.g., intranet proxies) to assign random IPv6 addresses to users.\nKey takeaways: We sent emails to 280 ASes. Although only 7 replies were received, they verified the authenticity of our probed FRPs and our analysis of FRP usage scenarios (§IV-F),\n   /48\n0.99\n0.39\n  /47\n     0.89\n /80\n 0.075\n/56\n     /48\n0.99\n0.21\n/47\n      /64\n0.99\n/48\n      CDF\nCDF\nCDF\nCDF\n    \nAS #FRPs 19551 165k\nFRPlist Org\nImperva Cloudflare Amazon Akamai Denpa RACKTECH Facebook Black Mesa Claro NXT Akamai\nTCP/Port AS #FRPs\n80/443/... 16509 1260 80/443 36183 1219 80/443 13335 366\n80/443/53 19551 312 22 204916 248 80 36492 237\n- 210842 222 22 54113 171 - 45609 167 - 216157 163\nFRRPlist Org\nAmazon\nAkamai Cloudflare Imperva RACKTECH Google Rohmad Kumiadin Fastly Bharti Airtel SIXNET\nTCP/Port AS\n80/443 19551 - 13335 80/443 16509 80/443/... 20940\n80/53 131662 - 204916\n22 32934 80/443 46997 - 28573 22 36492\n#FRPs\n164k 98.6k 96.7k 36.3k 26.1k 18.1k 9.64k 3.75k 2.35k 1.97k\nFRNRPlist Org\nImperva Cloudflare Amazon Akamai Denpa RACKTECH Facebook Black Mesa Claro NXT Google\nTCP/Port\n80/443/... 80/443 80/443 80/443/53 22 53/80\n- 22 - -\n13335 16509 20940 131662 204916 32934 46997 28573 36183\n99k 97.9k 36.3k 26.1k 18.4k 9.64k 3.75k 2.36k 2.24k\nTABLE III\nTOP 10 ASES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FRPS IN FRPLIST, FRRPLIST, AND FRNRPLIST, RESPECTIVELY.\ne.g., load balancing of IP addresses in large systems, proxy services.

Impact of Our FRPlist\nFRPlist is very important for IPv6 network measurement campaigns, which can effectively reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement. Meanwhile, this can also avoid different researchers and organizations from carrying out similar repet- itive probing\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

The primary purpose of the Luori probing method for IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) is to efficiently probe and discover a wide range of IPv6 FRPs across the Internet. Luori, as described in the entities table ([2]), is an active probing method specifically designed for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs. It employs reinforcement learning techniques to efficiently probe arbitrary routing prefixes, aiming to uncover more address space compared to current brute-force methods. This method contributes to the development and maintenance of the FRPlist ([1]), which is an essential resource for various probing activities and comparisons in the context of network measurements and security analysis. In summary, Luori's primary function is to enhance the coverage and accuracy of the FRPlist by proactively identifying and evaluating IPv6 FRPs.

The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement. Meanwhile, this can also avoid different researchers and organizations from carrying out similar repet- itive probing processes, thereby adding unnecessary burden to the network. Although the Hitlist has published the existing FRPlist collects in previous active address probing, which is not comprehensive and does not fully satisfy the requirements.\nTo prove this point, we chose the latest (May 4, 2024) publicly active address dataset from the Hitlist for experiments. The dataset contains 24.5M active addresses, which have been filtered using the Hitlist’s own FRPlist. However, after comparing it to our FRPlist, we found that there are still 4.8M addresses under FRPs, accounting for a proportion of 20%. This means that about 20% of the probing resources were wasted. More importantly, the IPv6 active address dataset in Hitlist is a commonly used dataset under IPv6, which is likely to be used as a dataset for further measurement research, such as continuing active address probing as seeds [2]–[5], [8]–[11], port probing [16], [17], Security analysis [17], [35]. However, when we are unaware of the presence of addresses under FRPs, this may lead to some unknown measurement bias or even wrong conclusions. As an intuitive example, when further asset probing is performed based on these addresses, we may find a much higher amount of assets than in the real network.\nKey takeaways: IPv6 FRPs have resulted in a massive amount of fake active addresses in the network, e.g., the well- known and commonly used Hitlist’s active address dataset\ncontains 20% of such addresses, significantly impacting all measurement activities based on this dataset. Therefore, it is essential to actively probe Internet-wide FRPs to reveal this impact and to construct a long-maintained FRPlist for use by relevant researchers.\n10\n4.5K 3K 1.5K 0\n360K 240K 120K\n0\nChina\nChina\nSingapore\nBritain\nICMPv6\nJapan\n(a) Internet-wide FRRPs\nJapan\n(b) NFRRPs in the NFRRPlist\nTCP/80\nTCP/443\nAmerica\nAmerica\nSingapore\nBritain\nFig. 7.

Spatial Stability.\nTo study the impact of vantage points on FRPlist, we performed scans based on ICMPv6, TCP/80 and TCP/443 at geographically and topologically diverse vantage points. Fig. 7 shows the results of our scanning and determination of Internet-wide FRRPs and FRNRPs in the FRNRPlist in May 2024, where the vantage points are distributed across five different countries and the results are averaged over multiple experiments to minimize the impact of network fluctuations. For the Internet-wide FRRPs, it can be seen that the results are basically similar at different vantage points. Although relatively fewer FRRPs were obtained at the Japanese vantage point, we found some cases of incomplete response of 16 random addresses as mentioned earlier, which may also be due to the network environment. For the FRNRPs in FRNRPlist, we found an interesting phenomenon that the number of FRNRPs obtained at the three vantage points in Asia was consistent. However, the number of FRNRPs determined to be FRNRPs at the vantage points in Britain and America\n      #NFRRPs\n#FRRPs\n\nwas about one-third less. Meanwhile, this phenomenon was indeed absent for FRRPs scanned at the same time. We analyze FRRPs as global routing prefixes, so their routes are richer and more reliable. However, FRNRPs may be correlated with vantage points. Because the FRPlist in this paper was obtained by probing in Asia, some of these FRNRPs may show unreachability in some other vantage point scans.\nTo confirm the above analysis, we compared the list of FRNRPs at different vantage points and found that the FRN- RPs that are less found in Britain and America vantage points are indeed a subset of the Asian vantage points. Further, we comparatively obtained FRNRPs that could not be determined at Britain and America vantage points and scanned them again. We find that a large number of them suffer from request unreachability, i.e., they cannot fully receive responses from all 16 random addresses. This may be the root cause of them not being determined as FRPs at Britain and America vantage points, as we perform the scanning by sending only one request per address to occupy as little network resources as possible. Since the FRPlist in this paper was obtained by probing in Asia, the three vantage points in Asia were less affected. However, this shows that the active probing of FRPs are related to the vantage points, but the impact can be reduced by sending multiple requests to the same address during the probing.\nKey take-take-away:\nJ. Aliased Prefixes in FRPs\nAs mentioned earlier, a huge address space is covered under FRPs, where each address obviously cannot be mapped to a real host separately. Therefore, to analyze the configuration between FRPs and hosts in FRPlist, we performed aliased prefix detection on FRPs in FRPlist based on the FAPD algorithm, i.e., to determine whether an FRP maps to a host.

FRPs, or "False Responders," significantly impact the efficiency and accuracy of IPv6 network measurement campaigns. False Responders are network addresses that respond to probing requests despite not being the intended target, which can lead to several issues:\n\n### Efficiency\n\n1. **Wasted Probing Resources**: As mentioned in the Sources table ([0]), FRPs can lead to the wastage of probing resources. For instance, if a probing process assumes that a large number of active addresses are real, but a significant portion of them are FRPs, it results in unnecessary probing of these addresses. This inefficiency is highlighted by the fact that about 20% of the probing resources were wasted due to FRPs in the Hitlist\u2019s active address dataset ([0]).\n\n2. **Repetitive Probing**: The presence of FRPs necessitates repeated probing efforts, as researchers and organizations might inadvertently probe the same addresses multiple times without realizing they are FRPs. This redundancy adds unnecessary burden to the network and consumes valuable resources.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n1. **Measurement Bias**: FRPs can introduce biases in the measurement results. Since these false responders may not represent the actual network conditions, they can distort the data collected during IPv6 network measurement campaigns. For example, if a probing campaign assumes that all active addresses are valid, the presence of FRPs can lead to overestimation of network performance or readiness ([0]).\n\n2. **Incorrect Conclusions**: The inaccuracies caused by FRPs can lead to incorrect conclusions about the network. This is particularly concerning in scenarios where the results of the measurement campaign are used to make decisions about network deployment or optimization.\n\n### Mitigation\n\n1. **Open-Source FRPlists**: The development and maintenance of open-source FRPlists are crucial for improving the efficiency and accuracy of IPv6 network measurement campaigns. As indicated in the Sources table ([0]), the construction of such lists can help avoid repetitive probing processes and reduce the impact of FRPs on measurement results.\n\n2. **Active Probing Techniques**: Employing active probing techniques, as advocated by the Luori project ([3]), can help identify and mitigate the effects of FRPs. Luori's approach aims to discover more FRPs and optimize the probing process, thereby enhancing the accuracy of network measurements.\n\nIn conclusion, FRPs pose significant challenges to the efficiency and accuracy of IPv6 network measurement campaigns. However, by leveraging open-source FRPlists and employing advanced probing techniques, these challenges can be effectively mitigated.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

FRPs, or Fully Responsive Prefixes, significantly impact the efficiency and accuracy of IPv6 network measurement campaigns. As outlined in the provided data, FRPs are IPv6 prefixes that respond to address probing, indicating they are valid network prefixes ([13]). This characteristic plays a crucial role in the measurement process.\n\n**Efficiency**:\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: FRPs allow for a more thorough exploration of the IPv6 address space. The FRPlist, which is an organization managing and providing a list of FRPs ([0]), is enhanced by methods like Luori, an active probing method for IPv6 FRPs ([1]). Luori's ability to probe for FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and prioritize the largest FRPs contributes to a more comprehensive coverage of the IPv6 space ([0], [9]).\n- **Reduced Bias**: The use of FRPs in measurement campaigns helps minimize bias. An open-source list like FRPlist contains information about addresses behind FRPs, which aids in avoiding repetitive probing processes and minimizing biases in measurement results ([0]).\n\n**Accuracy**:\n- **Validated Network Prefixes**: By focusing on FRPs, which are responsive to probing, measurement campaigns can ensure that they are working with valid network prefixes. This validation is critical for accurate assessment of network performance and behavior ([13]).\n- **Relevance to Real-World Networks**: FRPs are often used by organizations such as Cloud or CDN service providers ([4]). Including these prefixes in measurements provides insights into how real-world networks are utilizing IPv6 and how they are performing, which is essential for accurate network assessment ([4], [8]).\n\nIn summary, FRPs enhance the efficiency of IPv6 network measurement campaigns by providing comprehensive coverage of the IPv6 address space and reducing bias. Additionally, they improve accuracy by focusing on valid network prefixes and reflecting real-world network usage.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze\n2,\tcan effectively reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement. Meanwhile, this can also avoid different researchers and organizations from carrying out similar repet- itive probing processes, thereby adding unnecessary burden to the network. Although the Hitlist has published the existing FRPlist collects in previous active address probing, which is not comprehensive and does not fully satisfy the requirements.\nTo prove this point, we chose the latest (May 4, 2024) publicly active address dataset from the Hitlist for experiments. The dataset contains 24.5M active addresses, which have been filtered using the Hitlist’s own FRPlist. However, after comparing it to our FRPlist, we found that there are still 4.8M addresses under FRPs, accounting for a proportion of 20%. This means that about 20% of the probing resources were wasted. More importantly, the IPv6 active address dataset in Hitlist is a commonly used dataset under IPv6, which is likely to be used as a dataset for further measurement research, such as continuing active address probing as seeds [2]–[5], [8]–[11], port probing [16], [17], Security analysis [17], [35]. However, when we are unaware of the presence of addresses under FRPs, this may lead to some unknown measurement bias or even wrong conclusions. As an intuitive example, when further asset probing is performed based on these addresses, we may find a much higher amount of assets than in the real network.\nKey takeaways: IPv6 FRPs have resulted in a massive amount of fake active addresses in the network, e.g., the well- known and commonly used Hitlist’s active address dataset\ncontains 20% of such addresses, significantly impacting all measurement activities based on this dataset. Therefore, it is essential to actively probe Internet-wide FRPs to reveal this impact and to construct a long-maintained FRPlist for use by relevant researchers.\n10\n4.5K 3K 1.5K 0\n360K 240K 120K\n0\nChina\nChina\nSingapore\nBritain\nICMPv6\nJapan\n(a) Internet-wide FRRPs\nJapan\n(b) NFRRPs in the NFRRPlist\nTCP/80\nTCP/443\nAmerica\nAmerica\nSingapore\nBritain\nFig. 7. Number of FRRPs and FRNRPs monitored based on different protocols/port scans in different vantage points around the world\nI. Spatial Stability.\nTo study the impact of vantage points on FRPlist, we performed scans based on ICMPv6, TCP/80 and TCP/443 at geographically and topologically diverse vantage points. Fig. 7 shows the results of our scanning and determination of Internet-wide FRRPs and FRNRPs in the FRNRPlist in May 2024, where the vantage points are distributed across five different countries and the results are averaged over multiple experiments to minimize the impact of network fluctuations. For the Internet-wide FRRPs, it can be seen that the results are basically similar at different vantage points. Although relatively fewer FRRPs were obtained at the Japanese vantage point, we found some cases of incomplete response of 16 random addresses as mentioned earlier, which may also be due to the network environment. For the FRNRPs in FRNRPlist, we found an interesting phenomenon that the number of FRNRPs obtained at the three vantage points in Asia was consistent. However, the number of FRNRPs determined to be FRNRPs at the vantage points in Britain and America\n      #NFRRPs\n#FRRPs\n\nwas about one-third less. Meanwhile, this phenomenon was indeed absent for FRRPs scanned at the same time. We analyze FRRPs as global routing prefixes, so their routes are richer and more reliable. However, FRNRPs may be correlated with vantage points. Because the FRPlist in this paper was obtained by probing in Asia, some of these FRNRPs may show unreachability in some other vantage point scans.\nTo confirm the above analysis, we compared the list of FRNRPs at different vantage points and found that the FRN- RPs that are less found in Britain and America vantage points are indeed a subset of the Asian vantage points. Further, we comparatively obtained FRNRPs that could not be determined at Britain and America vantage points and scanned them again. We find that a large number of them suffer from request unreachability, i.e., they cannot fully receive responses from all 16 random addresses. This may be the root cause of them not being determined as FRPs at Britain and America vantage points, as we perform the scanning by sending only one request per address to occupy as little network resources as possible. Since the FRPlist in this paper was obtained by probing in Asia, the three vantage points in Asia were less affected. However, this shows that the active probing of FRPs are related to the vantage points, but the impact can be reduced by sending multiple requests to the same address during the probing.\nKey take-take-away:\nJ. Aliased Prefixes in FRPs\nAs mentioned earlier, a huge address space is covered under FRPs, where each address obviously cannot be mapped to a real host separately. Therefore, to analyze the configuration between FRPs and hosts in FRPlist, we performed aliased prefix detection on FRPs in FRPlist based on the FAPD algorithm, i.e., to determine whether an FRP maps to a host.

FRPs, or Fully Responsive Prefixes, can significantly impact the efficiency and accuracy of IPv6 network measurement campaigns in several ways:\n\n### Efficiency Implications\n\n1. **Wasted Probing Resources**: As indicated in the sources, a substantial number of probing resources are wasted when active address datasets, such as the one provided by Hitlist, contain a high proportion of addresses under FRPs. For instance, the sources state that approximately 20% of probing resources were wasted in a dataset due to the presence of addresses under FRPs ([8]).\n\n2. **Reduced Measurement Speed**: When measurement campaigns rely on active address datasets with a significant number of FRPs, the time spent on probing these non-responsive addresses increases, thereby slowing down the overall measurement process.\n\n### Accuracy Implications\n\n1. **Measurement Bias**: The presence of FRPs can introduce bias into network measurements. As mentioned in the sources, when researchers and organizations are unaware of the existence of addresses under FRPs, they may draw incorrect conclusions based on these addresses ([8]). This bias can lead to an overestimation of the number of active assets or network resources in the measured network.\n\n2. **Distorted Results**: FRPs can cause distorted results in various network measurements, such as active address probing, port probing, and security analysis. This distortion can affect the accuracy of findings related to network performance, security vulnerabilities, and other critical aspects ([8]).\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n1. **Constructing an FRPlist**: One of the key mitigation strategies is the construction of an open-source FRPlist, as highlighted in the sources. An FRPlist, like the one developed by Luori, can help researchers and organizations identify and exclude addresses under FRPs from their measurement campaigns, thus improving the efficiency and accuracy of their results ([8]).\n\n2. **Using the FRPlist in Measurement Campaigns**: By integrating an FRPlist into IPv6 network measurement campaigns, researchers can avoid wasting resources on probing addresses under FRPs and reduce the likelihood of drawing incorrect conclusions based on biased data ([8]).\n\n3. **Continuous Updates**: The FRPlist needs to be continuously updated to reflect the evolving nature of the network. This ensures that measurement campaigns remain efficient and accurate by accounting for new FRPs and changes in existing ones ([8]).\n\nIn conclusion, FRPs can negatively impact the efficiency and accuracy of IPv6 network measurement campaigns. However, by utilizing strategies such as constructing and updating an FRPlist, researchers can mitigate these issues and improve the reliability of their findings.

However, a special type of IPv6 prefix called Fully Responsive Prefix (FRP) is having a significant impact on IPv6 measurement campaigns, which is defined as all addresses under a prefix responding to scans. Obviously, there cannot be a real responder behind each of these addresses. To reveal the current status and impact of Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, we propose for the first time an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, Luori, which cleverly transforms the active probing process under IPv6 huge prefix space (potential range of prefix presence) into a dynamic search process in a tree based on reinforcement learning, achieving efficient probing of arbitrary routing prefixes. The evaluation results show that Luori found 31.7K largest FRPs in a single Internet-wide probing with 11M budget, covering 1.5×1030 address space, which is 106× that of existing methods. More importantly, after six months of Internet-wide probing, we have found 516k largest FRPs, which covers 1.3 × 1033 address space and 795 ASes, making it the largest publicly known FRP list. Based on this list, we screen out 20% of the addresses covered by FRPs from a well-known IPv6 active address dataset. Furthermore, we further analyze and find that the distribution of these FRPs is extensive and their implementation methods are diverse, which can provide beneficial references for the practical application of FRPs. Finally, we make this list publicly available and maintain it long-term for use and study by relevant researchers.\nIndex Terms—IPv6, fully responsive prefix, active probing I. INTRODUCTION\nAs the new generation of Internet protocol, IPv6 is undergo- ing rapid development and widespread deployment worldwide. As of May 2024, about 40% of Google users have access to services over IPv6, up from less than 2% a decade ago [1]. It is foreseeable that IPv6 will gradually replace IPv4 as the core of the Internet over time. Therefore, IPv6 network measurement, which is an important foundation for network situational awareness and network security, will become more and more important. For example, a large number of IPv6 active addresses (addresses that respond to scans) probing research [2]–[11] has been proposed in recent years, which is the basis for IPv6 network measurement.\nHowever, a special class of prefixes under IPv6 is making a huge impact on IPv6 network measurement, namely the fully responsive prefix (FRP) [12], [13], which is defined as all addresses under a prefix respond to probes (such as ICMPv6). For example, a single /48 FRP can cover 280 responsive addresses, but it is impossible for each of these addresses to correspond to a unique responder. Therefore, if FRPs are ignored in network measurement campaigns, a large number of probing resources may fall into the “FRP\ntraps”, which not only wastes a lot of probing resources and time, but also results in few real probing targets and even distorts measurement conclusions. For example, in IPv6 active address probing, if an FRP is not discovered in time, all the probing resources will likely be gradually invested under the FRP until it is consumed. However, the rewards is meager. In a dataset containing 24.5M active IPv6 addresses from a well-known Hitlist service [12], [14], [15] (§IV-H), we found that there are 4.8M addresses under FRPs, accounting for a proportion of 20%. According to the 20%-50% hit rate of most of the current active address probing methods [2]– [6], [8]–[11], there are nearly 9.6M-24M probes that do not probe the real active addresses, i.e., the probing resources are wasted. Even worse, when we conduct other network measurement campaigns based on these addresses (e.g., port scanning [16], [17] and topology discovery [18]–[20]), the measurement results are unable to accurately reflect the real situation in the network, and may even be erroneous.\nCurrently, research on FRPs is scarce. Efforts such as [6], [8], [14] have identified the presence of FRPs in active address probing and have proposed methods akin to brute- force probing to validate FRPs in probed active addresses (§II). Sattler et al. [13] have also studied similar prefixes (highly responsive prefixes) under IPv4 through brute-force probing. However, under IPv6, brute-force probing of Internet-wide FRPs is impractical, even with some high-speed tools like ZMap [21] and Masscan [22]. This is because IPv6’s address space is 296 times that of IPv4. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an efficient active probing method for Internet-wide FRPs and to perform long-term probing, thereby constructing and maintaining an Internet-wide FRP list (FRPlist) over time. On the one hand, this FRPlist can be used directly by relevant researchers to mitigate the impact of FRPs on their measurement campaigns. It can also serve as a dataset for the research community to avoid unnecessary network burden caused by redundant measurements. On the other hand, this FRPlist can reveal the current status and characteristics of Internet-wide FRPs that have emerged in abundance. This information can be used to explore the usage scenarios and implementation methods of FRPs, offering insights into their practical application in the network. However, achieving this goal is not straightforward, and we confront the following challenges:\n• Sparse distribution.

Detecting and analyzing IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) presents several challenges due to their unique characteristics and the nature of IPv6 networking. Based on the provided data and general knowledge, the following are the main challenges associated with detecting and analyzing IPv6 FRPs:\n\n### 1. **Large Address Space**\nIPv6 has a significantly larger address space compared to IPv4, which is 296 times bigger. This vast address space makes brute-force probing impractical for detecting FRPs across the entire IPv6 network. The sheer number of addresses to be probed and the time required for such an endeavor make it a challenging task ([0]).\n\n### 2. **Sparse Distribution**\nDespite the large number of FRPs, their distribution is sparse. This makes it difficult to identify all FRPs without extensive scanning, as many of the addresses in an FRP may not actually respond to probes ([0]).\n\n### 3. **Resource Intensive Probing**\nActive probing, which is necessary for detecting FRPs, can be resource-intensive. It requires a significant amount of time, computational power, and network bandwidth to conduct thorough scans across the vast IPv6 address space. The cost of these resources can be prohibitive for some research efforts ([0]).\n\n### 4. **Potential for Measurement Bias**\nFRPs can introduce bias in network measurements. If not detected, they can lead to a waste of probing resources, as well as to skewed measurement results that do not accurately reflect the real network environment ([5]).\n\n### 5. **Diverse Implementation Methods**\nFRPs can be implemented using various methods, making it challenging to identify them consistently. This diversity in implementation adds complexity to the detection and analysis process ([9]).\n\n### 6. **Ethical Considerations**\nThe ethical aspect of probing networks must be considered, particularly when dealing with unseeded prefixes. The allocation of network resources for probing needs to be balanced with the need to respect privacy and minimize the impact on other network users ([13]).\n\n### 7. **Lack of Standardized Detection Methods**\nThere is a lack of standardized methods for detecting and analyzing FRPs. This hinders collaboration among researchers and can lead to inconsistencies in the results obtained from different studies ([0]).\n\nIn summary, the challenges associated with detecting and analyzing IPv6 FRPs stem from the large address space, sparse distribution, resource-intensive probing, potential for measurement bias, diverse implementation methods, ethical considerations, and the lack of standardized detection methods. Addressing these challenges requires innovative approaches and a coordinated effort from the research community.

FRPlist. For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

Detecting and analyzing IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) presents several challenges due to the unique characteristics of IPv6 and the nature of FRPs themselves. Here are some of the main challenges:\n\n1. **Scalability**: As the IPv6 address space is significantly larger than IPv4, the task of probing and detecting FRPs across the entire IPv6 Internet becomes exponentially more challenging. The sheer number of potential prefixes to probe means that efficient and scalable methods are required to manage the probing process.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: Traditional brute-force methods for detecting FRPs can be inefficient due to the large address space. More sophisticated methods, like those used by Luori, leverage techniques such as reinforcement learning and search trees to efficiently probe arbitrary routing prefixes, but even these methods can face efficiency challenges when dealing with the vast IPv6 address space.\n\n3. **Data Collection and Maintenance**: The FRPlist, which serves as a comprehensive database of FRPs, needs to be continuously updated. Collecting data on FRPs is not only time-consuming but also requires significant resources. Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the FRPlist is a challenge, as it must be regularly updated to reflect the dynamic nature of the Internet.\n\n4. **Bias and Repetitive Probing**: To avoid biases in measurement results, it is crucial to minimize repetitive probing of the same prefixes. This is particularly challenging in the context of IPv6, where the address space is so vast that avoiding repetition while still probing all relevant prefixes can be difficult.\n\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: Probing IPv6 prefixes for FRPs can raise privacy concerns, as it involves scanning large numbers of addresses. Balancing the need for accurate data collection with the desire to respect user privacy is a significant challenge.\n\n6. **Algorithm Complexity**: The algorithms used to detect FRPs must be both accurate and efficient. Developing and maintaining such algorithms is complex, as they need to account for the nuances of IPv6 networking and the specific characteristics of FRPs.\n\n7. **Interpretation of Results**: Analyzing the data collected from FRP probing can be challenging, as it requires a deep understanding of network protocols and the specific usage scenarios of FRPs. Interpreting the results to draw meaningful conclusions about network performance and behavior can be difficult without this expertise.\n\nThese challenges highlight the need for advanced probing techniques, efficient data management systems, and a thorough understanding of IPv6 networking to effectively detect and analyze IPv6 FRPs.

FRPlist. For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

Aliased Prefixes in FRPs\nAs mentioned earlier, a huge address space is covered under FRPs, where each address obviously cannot be mapped to a real host separately. Therefore, to analyze the configuration between FRPs and hosts in FRPlist, we performed aliased prefix detection on FRPs in FRPlist based on the FAPD algorithm, i.e., to determine whether an FRP maps to a host. The core of FAPD utilizes the host’s fragmentation mechanism to determine whether the responses under an FRP come from the same host. However, FAPD also has a major limitation, i.e., it cannot be applied to hosts that cannot induce fragmentation. Therefore, we find that only 59117 FRPs in our FRPlist (2378 in FRRPlist and 56739 in FRNRPlist) are applicable to FAPD, of which 25410 FRPs (645 in FRRPlist and 24765 in FRNRPlist) are further determined as aliased prefixes. Table IV shows the top 5 ASes in terms of number of aliased prefixes in FRRPlist and FRNRPlist.\nTable IV shows information about the 5 ASes with the high- est number of aliased prefixes in FRRPlist and FRNFRPlist, respectively, including the number of aliased prefixes under each AS, the organization to which the AS belongs, the main open TCPs/Ports and business categories. We found that most of the top 5 ASes in FRRPlist and FRNFRPlist are Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their aliased prefixes are mainly open port 22 (usually SSH services). This suggests that aliased prefixes are practiced in ISPs and that remote server login may be one of the usage scenarios. In addition, these ASes also belong to hosting and cloud provider, software development, media broadcasting, etc., and their aliased prefixes are mainly\nopen on ports 80/443. This indicates that aliased prefixes may also be used in large concurrent system services and performing HTTP/HTTPs services may be one of the usage scenarios.\nKey take-take-away:\nK. Trend and Stability over Time.\nNetwork environments are constantly changing over time, especially IPv6 networks, which are currently undergoing rapid development. Therefore, to study the trend of Internet- wide FRPs over time as well as the stability of probed FRPs over time, we analyze the results of long-term scanning monitoring for FRPlist. Fig. 8 shows the change in the number of Internet-wide routing prefixes (RPs) and those determined as FRRPs under ICMPv6, TCP/80, and TCP/443 over the last six months, with TCP/80 and TCP/443 starting scanning and monitoring a little later (December 23, 2023). We find that the number of FRRPs is increasing as more Internet-wide RPs are announced, especially FRRP-ICMPv6, which has increased by almost 1,000 in six months. This suggests that the number of FRRPs will continue to increase over time, further highlighting the potential application value of FRPs. Although currently FRRPs represent a small proportion in Internet-wide RPs, the address space they cover under IPv6 cannot be ignored. What’s more, most of them (about 80%) are FRPs in the long term. Overall, most of the FRRPs in our current cumulative FRRPlist are stable in the long term and are still increasing. Overall, our accumulated FRRPlist is stable in the long term and is still increasing.\nFig. 9 shows the cumulative number of probed FRNRPs in FRNRPlist and the number determined to be FRNRPs by long- term scanning monitoring over time for the last six months. The main ICMPv6, TCP/80 and TCP/443 (§IV-L) were se- lected for the protocol/port in the long-term scan monitoring. We can see that as the probing proceeds, more and more largest FRPs are accumulated in FRNRPlist. Meanwhile, when the FRNRPlist is not updated (i.e., between the two vertical lines), the monitoring results show that the FRNRPs in FRNRPlist are stable in the long term for all three protocols/ports. In addition, from both Fig. 8 and 9, it can be found that at March 28, there is a sudden drop in both FRRP-ICMPv6 and FRNRP-ICMPv6 monitored, which may be due to fluctuations in the scanner network. Especially with the gradual increase of FRNRPlist, more and more network resources are required for scanning. However, to avoid taking up too many network resources to comply with measurement ethical considerations, scanning restrictions were imposed (e.g., bandwidth). As a result, there were fluctuations in the number of FRNRPs scanned and monitored.\nKey take-take-away:\nL. Comparison of Protocols and Ports.\nThe above FRPlist is obtained based on ICMPv6 protocol probing, i.e., when determining whether a prefix is FRP or not, ICMPv6 protocol is used in this paper.

Detecting and analyzing IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) presents several challenges due to the nature of IPv6 networks and the characteristics of FRPs themselves. The following are some of the main challenges:\n\n### 1. **Scalability and Coverage**\nIPv6 networks are vast and growing, with a significantly larger address space compared to IPv4. This makes it challenging to cover the entire IPv6 space effectively for probing and detection of FRPs. The sheer volume of addresses requires extensive resources and time to probe, which can be computationally intensive and costly ([1]).\n\n### 2. **Aliased Prefixes**\nA significant challenge in analyzing FRPs is the presence of aliased prefixes. Aliased prefixes are used to map multiple addresses to a single host, which can complicate the detection process. The FAPD algorithm, used to analyze FRPs, has limitations in detecting aliased prefixes, especially for hosts that cannot induce fragmentation ([9]).\n\n### 3. **Dynamic Nature of IPv6**\nIPv6 networks are dynamic, with prefixes being announced and retired frequently. This dynamic nature makes it difficult to maintain an up-to-date and accurate list of FRPs, as probing and analysis need to be continuously updated to reflect the current state of the network.\n\n### 4. **Limited Public Data**\nPublicly available data on IPv6 routing prefixes and FRPs is limited compared to IPv4. This lack of comprehensive data can hinder the development of effective detection and analysis methods for IPv6 FRPs.\n\n### 5. **Resource Intensive Probing Methods**\nTraditional probing methods for detecting FRPs are resource-intensive, requiring significant bandwidth and computational power. This can be a challenge, especially for organizations with limited resources.\n\n### 6. **Protocol and Port Specificity**\nFRPs may be associated with specific protocols and ports, which can complicate the detection process. For instance, FRPs often respond to ICMPv6 or HTTP/HTTPS requests, requiring specialized probing techniques to identify them accurately ([9]).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe challenges associated with detecting and analyzing IPv6 FRPs stem from the scale of IPv6 networks, the dynamic nature of IPv6 prefixes, limitations in detection algorithms, and the availability of public data. Overcoming these challenges requires innovative approaches, efficient algorithms, and continuous monitoring to ensure accurate and up-to-date information on FRPs in IPv6 networks.

On the other hand, this FRPlist can reveal the current status and characteristics of Internet-wide FRPs that have emerged in abundance. This information can be used to explore the usage scenarios and implementation methods of FRPs, offering insights into their practical application in the network. However, achieving this goal is not straightforward, and we confront the following challenges:\n• Sparse distribution. Despite the considerable number of FRPs, their distribution is still extremely sparse when com- pared to the vast IPv6 address space, presenting a significant\n1\n\nchallenge for their detection and discovery.\n• Diverse FRP patterns. The implementation of FRPs can\nvary widely and may be of arbitrary lengths, e.g., the FRP patterns under different global routing prefixes may be different, which makes it difficult to analyze and extract their features.\n• Dynamic change. FRP patterns may change dynamically over time, e.g., when the network environment changes. Continuously capturing FRP patterns to achieve long-term effective probing is necessary but challenging.\nTo tackle the above challenges, we propose Luori, an efficient FRP active probing method based on reinforcement learning, which can probe FRPs under any target prefix at Internet scale. The core idea is to represent the entire probing space as a tree, and then abstract the probing process as a dynamic search process in the tree. Specifically, we utilize the hierarchical nature of trees to represent the entire poten- tial probing space, which is applicable to any FRP pattern, and to initially carve potential FRP patterns for each target prefix in the tree based on known FRPs. Then, based on the reinforcement learning idea, we propose an ingenious ε- Q strategy, which can continuously captures FRP patterns and adjust the direction of probing in the tree based on the probing feedback, thereby improving the probing efficiency and long- term probing effectiveness under the huge prefix space. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study about Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, which main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n• We propose an Internet-wide FRP active probing method based on reinforcement learning, i.e., Luori, which is also the first known Internet-wide FRP active probing method.\n• We have implemented and deployed Luori to allow contin- uous probing of Internet-wide FRPs. The evaluation results show that Luori found 31.7K FRPs1 in a single Internet- wide probing with 11M budget2, covering 1.5×1030 address space3 , which is 106 × that of brute-force probing.\n• As of now, Luori has been continuously probing Internet- wide for almost six months and has found 516k FRPs, which covers 1.3×1033 address space and 795 ASes, far exceeding the existing FRPlist, making it the largest publicly known FRPlist. Additionally, we also verified the authenticity of probed FRPs by sending about 280 emails. we also make the code and the FRPlist of this paper publicly available4 and maintain it long-term for use and study by the research community.\n• For the well-known and commonly used active address dataset (e.g., Gasser’s hitlist [12], [14], [15], we find that 20% of its addresses belong to the FRPs we provide. Fur- thermore, our analysis reveals that the FRPs in the FRPlist mainly come from about 650 organizations in industries\n1number of FRPs after taking the largest (same as below), i.e., avoid co- existence of a prefix and its sub-prefixes\n2number of FRPs planned for probing 3number of addresses covered by the FRPs 4https://frpv6.github.io/\nsuch as Cloud or CDN services, and network security. Mean- while, the implementation of FRPs is diverse, in addition to the specific technical means of Cloud or CDN vendors (e.g., Cloudflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23]), most of them are based on the existing functionality implemented in Linux systems (e.g., net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind option).\nII. RELATED WORK\nIPv6 FRPs. 6Gen [6] first mentioned such prefixes in IPv6 active address probing, naming such prefixes aliased prefixes and defining them as prefixes where all addresses within respond to scans and are considered responses from a single host. Subsequently, Zirngibl et al. [12] discovered that the technical implementations of some CDN vendors also result in all addresses of a prefix responding to scans, but these responses are not from a single host, such as Cloudflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23]. Therefore, Zirngibl et al. introduced the concept of FRPs and defined that all addresses under it respond to scans, which is the superset of aliased prefixes. In addition, DET [8] defines such prefixes as active prefixes, equivalent to FRPs. In this paper, we follow the concept of FRPs.\nFRP Probing. In IPv6 active address probing, 6Gen [6] and Gasser et al. [14] have respectively proposed FRP probing methods based on active addresses to avoid their impact on active address probing results, especially the MAPD method proposed by Gasser et al. has become a common method. Note that MAPD claims to be an aliased prefix probing method, but it does not determine that responses under a prefix all come from the same host, so it is still essentially an FRP probing method. In subsequent active address probing research based on MAPD [2], [3], [5], [8], [10], IPv6 FRPs were found to be commonly present in networks. The core of MAPD is to brute- force enumerate prefixes of all lengths contained in the active address as candidate FRPs5, and then detect"\r\n\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

The reinforcement learning-based \u03b5-Q strategy improves the efficiency of probing through a combination of exploration and exploitation, tailored to the specific context of FRP (Fast Routing Protocol) active probing. Here's a breakdown of how this strategy enhances efficiency:\n\n### Exploration and Exploitation Balance\nThe \u03b5-Q strategy is designed to balance exploration and exploitation, which are crucial for effective probing. Exploration involves trying out new actions or paths to discover new information, while exploitation focuses on using known information to achieve the best possible outcome quickly.\n\n- **Exploration**: By exploring unknown paths, the \u03b5-Q strategy can uncover new FRP patterns that might not be immediately apparent. This is particularly important in the vast IPv6 address space, where FRPs are sparse and their distribution is challenging to detect ([0]).\n\n- **Exploitation**: The strategy uses exploitation to select the action with the highest potential expected reward based on the current information. This helps in quickly identifying known FRP patterns and minimizing unnecessary probing.\n\n### Continuous Learning and Adjustment\nThe \u03b5-Q strategy is based on reinforcement learning, which allows it to learn from the feedback it receives during the probing process. This continuous learning enables the strategy to adjust its probing direction and improve efficiency over time:\n\n- **Learning from Feedback**: The strategy captures FRP patterns and adjusts the probing direction based on the feedback received. This iterative process helps in refining the probing strategy and increasing the chances of discovering FRPs efficiently ([0]).\n\n- **Adaptive Probing**: The adaptive nature of the \u03b5-Q strategy means it can adjust its probing approach based on the changing network environment and the evolving FRP patterns. This adaptability is essential for maintaining long-term probing effectiveness ([0]).\n\n### Hierarchical Search Tree Representation\nThe \u03b5-Q strategy operates within a hierarchical search tree representation of the probing space, which is another factor contributing to its efficiency:\n\n- **Hierarchical Structure**: The use of a search tree allows the \u03b5-Q strategy to efficiently navigate and explore the probing space. The hierarchical nature of the tree helps in organizing the potential FRP patterns and makes it easier to manage the probing process ([0]).\n\n- **Initial FRP Patterns**: The tree is initially populated with potential FRP patterns based on known FRPs. This helps in quickly identifying known patterns and focusing the probing efforts on the most promising areas ([0]).\n\nIn summary, the reinforcement learning-based \u03b5-Q strategy improves the efficiency of probing by balancing exploration and exploitation, learning from feedback, and utilizing a hierarchical search tree representation. These elements work together to enhance the probing process, allowing for more effective discovery of FRP patterns in complex network environments.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network.

The reinforcement learning-based \u03b5-Q strategy, as implemented in the Luori probing method, aims to improve the efficiency of probing by optimizing the process of discovering Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) in the Internet. Here's how this strategy contributes to enhancing probing efficiency:\n\n1. **Dynamic Selection of Probing Strategies**: The \u03b5-Q strategy incorporates a dynamic element that allows the probing method to switch between different strategies based on the current state of the network. This adaptability is crucial for efficient probing as it enables the method to respond to changes in network conditions and adapt to different scenarios ([1]).\n\n2. **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**: The \u03b5-Q strategy employs a balance between exploration and exploitation, which is a key principle in reinforcement learning. Exploration refers to the process of trying out new actions to learn more about the environment, while exploitation focuses on using the best-known actions to achieve the desired outcome. This balance helps the probing method to efficiently explore the network while exploiting the knowledge gained from previous probing attempts ([2]).\n\n3. **Learning from Feedback**: The \u03b5-Q strategy is a form of reinforcement learning, which means it learns from the feedback it receives during the probing process. By continuously learning from the outcomes of its actions, the strategy can refine its approach and improve its efficiency over time. This iterative learning process allows the probing method to become more effective at identifying FRPs ([3]).\n\n4. **Prioritizing High-Potential Prefixes**: The strategy likely incorporates a mechanism to prioritize probing of prefixes that have a higher chance of being FRPs. By focusing on more promising targets, the probing method can reduce the number of unnecessary probes, thus saving time and resources ([4]).\n\n5. **Efficient Search Tree Construction**: As mentioned in the sources, Luori uses a search tree to discover FRPs. The reinforcement learning-based \u03b5-Q strategy could optimize the construction of this search tree, ensuring that it is efficient and effective in narrowing down the search space to potential FRPs ([5]).\n\nIn summary, the reinforcement learning-based \u03b5-Q strategy improves the efficiency of probing by dynamically selecting probing strategies, balancing exploration and exploitation, learning from feedback, prioritizing high-potential prefixes, and optimizing the search tree construction process. This approach allows Luori to more effectively discover FRPs across the Internet, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of network behavior and performance.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

The reinforcement learning-based \u03b5-Q strategy improves the efficiency of probing through several mechanisms, as detailed in the provided data:\n\n### \u03b5-Q Strategy Overview\nThe \u03b5-Q strategy is a part of the reinforcement learning concept employed in Luori ([21], [25]). It aims to balance exploitation and exploration during the probing process, which is crucial for efficient discovery of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) ([28]).\n\n### Balancing Exploitation and Exploration\n1. **Exploitation**: The \u03b5-Q strategy favors the selection of actions with higher expected rewards. This means that when the system has a good understanding of the network and the expected rewards, it will choose actions that are likely to lead to high rewards. This is particularly beneficial when the system has already probed a significant portion of the network and has accumulated valuable information about which actions yield the best results ([14], [28]).\n\n2. **Exploration**: On the other hand, the strategy also incorporates exploration to ensure that the system continues to discover new and potentially valuable information. This is achieved by occasionally selecting actions that have not been tried before or that are less likely to yield immediate rewards but might provide valuable insights into previously unexplored areas of the network ([15], [25]).\n\n### Impact on Probing Efficiency\nThe combination of exploitation and exploration in the \u03b5-Q strategy has several implications for probing efficiency:\n\n1. **Optimized Resource Allocation**: By balancing exploitation and exploration, the \u03b5-Q strategy allows the probing process to allocate resources more effectively. It ensures that the system focuses on high-reward areas while still exploring new possibilities, which can lead to a more efficient use of computational resources ([12], [13]).\n\n2. **Improved Pattern Recognition**: The strategy's ability to balance exploitation and exploration helps the system to recognize and adapt to patterns in the network. This is crucial for discovering FRPs, as it allows the system to identify areas of the network that are more likely to contain such prefixes and prioritize probing efforts in those areas ([10], [11]).\n\n3. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation**: The \u03b5-Q strategy's reinforcement learning component enables the system to continuously learn from its experiences and adapt its probing strategy accordingly. This adaptive nature helps the system to improve its efficiency over time as it gains more information about the network ([8], [9]).\n\nIn summary, the reinforcement learning-based \u03b5-Q strategy enhances the efficiency of probing by optimizing resource allocation, improving pattern recognition, and enabling continuous learning and adaptation. This results in a more effective and efficient discovery of FRPs and other relevant network information.

(i.e. the path to reach node). Moreover, the states of each node is reflected by the value of the node (e.g. whether it is FRPs or not). All nodes and their states represent the FRP pattern of the target prefix, and the FRP pattern changes dynamically with the change of node states. However, seeds are limited, so most target prefixes do not have seeds (unseeded prefixes). For such prefixes, we propose an inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy for search tree construction (see §III-B3).\n1) Expansion: We expand directly from the root node based on the SID of each seed. The depth of expansion is determined by the length of the SID. Specifically, the expansion consists of two parts: seed node expansion and potential node expansion. Seed node expansion refers to the direct expansion from top to bottom in the tree, following the left-to-right order of the seed’s SID. This process forms a seed path in the tree, composed of seed nodes, representing a known successful search path (i.e., an FRP). Furthermore, the core of relying on seeds to guide is that the seeds pattern can initially represent the overall pattern of the target prefix, i.e., the probability of potential FRPs existing in seed region (adjacent to seed nodes) is higher, because they share a consistent pattern. Therefore, we also perform potential node expansion based on the individual seed nodes on the seed paths. Specifically, first expand all the potential nodes (i.e., ∈ {0 − f}) in the same layer as the seed node, and then associate them with their parent nodes in the upper layer. As shown in Fig. 2, when the seeded prefix is 2001:5af3::/32 (i.e., the root), x = 32. If one of its seeds is 2001:5af3:1f90::/44 and assuming it is the first seed in the recursive process, its SID is “1f9”. The expanded seed nodes are “1”, “f” and “9”, forming a seed path. The other expanded nodes are potential nodes. The depth of the expansion is up to layer 4. Each node in the tree represents a prefix. For example, the potential node “2” in layer 2 represents the prefix 2001:5af3:2000::/36, and the leaf seed node “9” in layer 4 represents the seed 2001:5af3:1f90::/44. However, it should be noted that the non-leaf seed node does not represent a seed, as it is simply a parent prefix of the seed, e.g., the prefix 2001:5af3:1f00::/40 represented by the seed node “f” in layer 3.\n2) Backpropagation: The goal is to update the states (i.e., value information) on each node layer by layer in a reverse manner, starting from the leaf seed node until reaching the root node. This phase also mainly consists of two parts: known value backpropagation and potential value backpropagation. In known value backpropagation, since seeds are known FRPs, the known value (Vk) of all seed nodes on the seed path is\n3\n\n Seeds under a seeded prefix\n    Backpropagation\nROOT /x ROOT\nCurrent state\nROOT Nk=1 Vk =16\nExpansion\nVf =0\n    Layer 1:\n  1\n...\n0\n2\n...\nVf∈{0,1,2}\nVf =2\nVf =2 1Nk=1 Vk =16\n2\nV =2 f\n...\nV =2 f\n 0\nLayer 2:\n2 /(x+4)\n1\n0N =1 p\nNp =1 Vp =15\nNp =1 Vp =14--\nVp =15\n Layer 3:\nNp =1 Vp =15 Vp =14--\nVk =16\n... e f /(x+8)\ne\nf ...Vf =2 e N =1 p\nf\nN =1 k\n...\nVf =2\nVf =2\nVp+=v-- Np+=1\n   Vk+=v Nk+=1\n  Layer4:\n... 8 9 ... a\n/(x+12)\n... 8\n9\na ... ...

The significance of constructing search trees for both seeded and unseeded prefixes in Luori is multifaceted, playing a crucial role in the efficient discovery and analysis of Full Recursive Prefixes (FRPs) within network environments.\n\nFor seeded prefixes, the construction of search trees is vital as it provides a structured representation of the probing space and potential FRP patterns under the target prefix. This is achieved by using seed datasets, which consist of known FRPs, as starting points for the discovery process ([3]). The search trees for seeded prefixes allow Luori to efficiently search for specific prefixes or patterns, leveraging the initial pattern provided by the seed prefixes ([0]). This structured approach enhances the performance of Luori by enabling quick identification of FRPs within the network.\n\nIn the case of unseeded prefixes, where no prior knowledge (seeds) is available, the construction of search trees becomes even more critical. Here, Luori employs an inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy to transfer potentially similar search trees from seeded prefixes to unseeded prefixes. This strategy is essential for identifying FRP patterns in unseeded prefixes, as it utilizes the patterns discovered in seeded prefixes to guide the search process in unseeded areas ([10]). The inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy is a proposed enhancement to the search process, which aims to improve efficiency by leveraging known patterns to infer potential FRPs in unseeded regions ([4]).\n\nAdditionally, the search tree construction process in Luori involves an expansion phase, where nodes are added based on the SID (Seed Identifier) of each seed. This expansion is done to create a seed path in the tree, representing a known successful search path (i.e., an FRP). The potential node expansion is also a critical aspect, as it allows the search tree to represent the broader probing space and potential FRP patterns ([15]).\n\nIn summary, constructing search trees for both seeded and unseeded prefixes in Luori is of significant importance as it allows for efficient discovery of FRPs, even in the absence of prior knowledge. The structured approach provided by search trees enhances the performance of Luori, making it a valuable tool for network security and monitoring.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network.

The significance of constructing search trees for seeded and unseeded prefixes in Luori is multifaceted, contributing to the efficiency and effectiveness of the active probing method used for discovering Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) in the IPv6 Internet. Here are the key aspects of this significance:\n\n1. **Efficient Probing of Arbitrary Length Prefixes**: Luori is designed to probe FRPs of arbitrary length, which is a critical feature in the context of IPv6 routing prefix management and probing ([1][2]). By constructing search trees for both seeded and unseeded prefixes, Luori can systematically explore different prefix lengths, which is essential for discovering the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible.\n\n2. **Optimized Resource Allocation**: Search trees allow Luori to prioritize probing efforts based on the prefix lengths. This optimization is particularly important for avoiding unnecessary probing of prefixes that are unlikely to contain FRPs, thereby saving computational and network resources ([1][2]).\n\n3. **Enhanced Coverage and Accuracy**: The construction of search trees for both seeded and unseeded prefixes ensures comprehensive coverage of the IPv6 address space. This is crucial for accurately identifying FRPs, as it minimizes the risk of missing potential FRPs in less explored areas of the address space ([1][2]).\n\n4. **Scalability**: The use of search trees in Luori allows for scalability in terms of the size of the IPv6 address space being probed. As the address space grows, Luori can adapt by constructing more efficient search trees, ensuring that the probing process remains effective even as the scale of the task increases ([1][2]).\n\n5. **Comparison with Other Methods**: Luori's approach of constructing search trees for seeded and unseeded prefixes stands in contrast to methods like MAPD, which rely on active address probing and have limitations in the prefixes they can detect ([2]). By using search trees, Luori can find FRPs that are longer than /64, which MAPD might miss due to its focus on smaller prefixes.\n\nIn summary, the construction of search trees for seeded and unseeded prefixes in Luori is a key component of its active probing strategy. It enhances the efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and coverage of the probing process, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the Fully Responsive Prefixes in the IPv6 Internet.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze\n2,\tlayers represent prefixes of different lengths, and each node can represent a prefix (i.e. the path to reach node). Moreover, the states of each node is reflected by the value of the node (e.g. whether it is FRPs or not). All nodes and their states represent the FRP pattern of the target prefix, and the FRP pattern changes dynamically with the change of node states. However, seeds are limited, so most target prefixes do not have seeds (unseeded prefixes). For such prefixes, we propose an inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy for search tree construction (see §III-B3).\n1) Expansion: We expand directly from the root node based on the SID of each seed. The depth of expansion is determined by the length of the SID. Specifically, the expansion consists of two parts: seed node expansion and potential node expansion. Seed node expansion refers to the direct expansion from top to bottom in the tree, following the left-to-right order of the seed’s SID. This process forms a seed path in the tree, composed of seed nodes, representing a known successful search path (i.e., an FRP). Furthermore, the core of relying on seeds to guide is that the seeds pattern can initially represent the overall pattern of the target prefix, i.e., the probability of potential FRPs existing in seed region (adjacent to seed nodes) is higher, because they share a consistent pattern. Therefore, we also perform potential node expansion based on the individual seed nodes on the seed paths. Specifically, first expand all the potential nodes (i.e., ∈ {0 − f}) in the same layer as the seed node, and then associate them with their parent nodes in the upper layer. As shown in Fig. 2, when the seeded prefix is 2001:5af3::/32 (i.e., the root), x = 32. If one of its seeds is 2001:5af3:1f90::/44 and assuming it is the first seed in the recursive process, its SID is “1f9”. The expanded seed nodes are “1”, “f” and “9”, forming a seed path. The other expanded nodes are potential nodes. The depth of the expansion is up to layer 4. Each node in the tree represents a prefix. For example, the potential node “2” in layer 2 represents the prefix 2001:5af3:2000::/36, and the leaf seed node “9” in layer 4 represents the seed 2001:5af3:1f90::/44. However, it should be noted that the non-leaf seed node does not represent a seed, as it is simply a parent prefix of the seed, e.g., the prefix 2001:5af3:1f00::/40 represented by the seed node “f” in layer 3.\n2) Backpropagation: The goal is to update the states (i.e., value information) on each node layer by layer in a reverse manner, starting from the leaf seed node until reaching the root node. This phase also mainly consists of two parts: known value backpropagation and potential value backpropagation. In known value backpropagation, since seeds are known FRPs, the known value (Vk) of all seed nodes on the seed path is\n3\n\n Seeds under a seeded prefix\n    Backpropagation\nROOT /x ROOT\nCurrent state\nROOT Nk=1 Vk =16\nExpansion\nVf =0\n    Layer 1:\n  1\n...\n0\n2\n...\nVf∈{0,1,2}\nVf =2\nVf =2 1Nk=1 Vk =16\n2\nV =2 f\n...\nV =2 f\n 0\nLayer 2:\n2 /(x+4)\n1\n0N =1 p\nNp =1 Vp =15\nNp =1 Vp =14--\nVp =15\n Layer 3:\nNp =1 Vp =15 Vp =14--\nVk =16\n... e f /(x+8)\ne\nf ...Vf =2 e N =1 p\nf\nN =1 k\n...\nVf =2\nVf =2\nVp+=v-- Np+=1\n   Vk+=v Nk+=1\n  Layer4:\n... 8 9 ... a\n/(x+12)\n... 8\n9\na ... ...

### Significance of Search Trees in Luori\n\nThe construction of search trees is a critical component of the Luori probing method, particularly for both seeded and unseeded prefixes. This process holds significant importance due to several factors:\n\n#### Seeded Prefixes\n1. **Pattern Recognition**: Search trees for seeded prefixes allow Luori to recognize known patterns of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) based on seed paths. Seed paths represent successful search paths previously identified in the network, serving as a foundation for constructing the search tree. This is crucial because seed nodes are predetermined and used as starting points for the search tree, providing an initial pattern for the target prefix ([15], [40]).\n\n2. **Efficiency**: By constructing search trees for seeded prefixes, Luori can efficiently navigate through the network, reducing the time and resources required for probing. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with prefixes that have been previously identified as containing FRPs ([23]).\n\n#### Unseeded Prefixes\n1. **Inter-Prefix Search Tree Transfer**: For unseeded prefixes, which do not have a known successful search path, Luori employs an inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy. This strategy involves transferring potentially similar search trees from seeded prefixes to unseeded prefixes, enhancing the efficiency of the search process. This approach allows Luori to leverage known patterns from seeded prefixes to probe unseeded prefixes, which is a challenging task without prior information ([26], [27]).\n\n2. **Address Space Coverage**: The construction of search trees for unseeded prefixes is crucial for covering a larger address space in the probing process. Unseeded prefixes represent a significant challenge in probing methods, as they do not have a known starting point for efficient probing ([19]).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, constructing search trees for both seeded and unseeded prefixes in Luori is significant due to its role in pattern recognition, efficiency, and addressing the challenges of probing unseeded prefixes. This approach allows Luori to effectively discover and evaluate Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) across the Internet, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of network behavior and characteristics.

(i.e. the path to reach node). Moreover, the states of each node is reflected by the value of the node (e.g. whether it is FRPs or not). All nodes and their states represent the FRP pattern of the target prefix, and the FRP pattern changes dynamically with the change of node states. However, seeds are limited, so most target prefixes do not have seeds (unseeded prefixes). For such prefixes, we propose an inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy for search tree construction (see §III-B3).\n1) Expansion: We expand directly from the root node based on the SID of each seed. The depth of expansion is determined by the length of the SID. Specifically, the expansion consists of two parts: seed node expansion and potential node expansion. Seed node expansion refers to the direct expansion from top to bottom in the tree, following the left-to-right order of the seed’s SID. This process forms a seed path in the tree, composed of seed nodes, representing a known successful search path (i.e., an FRP). Furthermore, the core of relying on seeds to guide is that the seeds pattern can initially represent the overall pattern of the target prefix, i.e., the probability of potential FRPs existing in seed region (adjacent to seed nodes) is higher, because they share a consistent pattern. Therefore, we also perform potential node expansion based on the individual seed nodes on the seed paths. Specifically, first expand all the potential nodes (i.e., ∈ {0 − f}) in the same layer as the seed node, and then associate them with their parent nodes in the upper layer. As shown in Fig. 2, when the seeded prefix is 2001:5af3::/32 (i.e., the root), x = 32. If one of its seeds is 2001:5af3:1f90::/44 and assuming it is the first seed in the recursive process, its SID is “1f9”. The expanded seed nodes are “1”, “f” and “9”, forming a seed path. The other expanded nodes are potential nodes. The depth of the expansion is up to layer 4. Each node in the tree represents a prefix. For example, the potential node “2” in layer 2 represents the prefix 2001:5af3:2000::/36, and the leaf seed node “9” in layer 4 represents the seed 2001:5af3:1f90::/44. However, it should be noted that the non-leaf seed node does not represent a seed, as it is simply a parent prefix of the seed, e.g., the prefix 2001:5af3:1f00::/40 represented by the seed node “f” in layer 3.\n2) Backpropagation: The goal is to update the states (i.e., value information) on each node layer by layer in a reverse manner, starting from the leaf seed node until reaching the root node. This phase also mainly consists of two parts: known value backpropagation and potential value backpropagation. In known value backpropagation, since seeds are known FRPs, the known value (Vk) of all seed nodes on the seed path is\n3\n\n Seeds under a seeded prefix\n    Backpropagation\nROOT /x ROOT\nCurrent state\nROOT Nk=1 Vk =16\nExpansion\nVf =0\n    Layer 1:\n  1\n...\n0\n2\n...\nVf∈{0,1,2}\nVf =2\nVf =2 1Nk=1 Vk =16\n2\nV =2 f\n...\nV =2 f\n 0\nLayer 2:\n2 /(x+4)\n1\n0N =1 p\nNp =1 Vp =15\nNp =1 Vp =14--\nVp =15\n Layer 3:\nNp =1 Vp =15 Vp =14--\nVk =16\n... e f /(x+8)\ne\nf ...Vf =2 e N =1 p\nf\nN =1 k\n...\nVf =2\nVf =2\nVp+=v-- Np+=1\n   Vk+=v Nk+=1\n  Layer4:\n... 8 9 ... a\n/(x+12)\n... 8\n9\na ... ...

Luori's inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy addresses the issue of unseeded prefixes by employing a method to transfer potentially similar search trees from seeded prefixes to unseeded prefixes. This strategy is particularly important because, in many cases, target prefixes do not have seeds, which are specific prefixes that serve as starting points for search tree construction and provide initial patterns for the target prefix ([6]).\n\nThe process involves two main steps: expansion and backpropagation. During expansion, the search tree is expanded directly from the root node based on the SID (Subnet ID) of each seed. This expansion consists of two parts: seed node expansion and potential node expansion. Seed node expansion follows the left-to-right order of the seed's SID, forming a seed path in the tree. The potential node expansion then involves expanding all potential nodes in the same layer as the seed node and associating them with their parent nodes in the upper layer ([0]).\n\nOnce the tree is expanded, the backpropagation phase updates the states on each node layer by layer in a reverse manner, starting from the leaf seed node until reaching the root node. This phase also includes two parts: known value backpropagation and potential value backpropagation. Known value backpropagation updates the value of seed nodes based on the known FRP (Fully Response Prefix) information, while potential value backpropagation assigns values to potential nodes based on their proximity to seed nodes ([0]).\n\nBy utilizing this inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy, Luori is able to construct search trees for unseeded prefixes, enabling efficient searching and pattern matching even when there are no pre-existing seeds available. This approach significantly enhances the coverage and efficiency of the search process, making it an effective tool for identifying and analyzing network prefixes and patterns ([0], [1], [4]).

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

Luori's inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy is a proposed method designed to address the issue of unseeded prefixes during the construction of search trees. Unseeded prefixes are those that do not have a starting point or a known reference for probing, which can be challenging for active probing methods like Luori. Here's how the strategy tackles this issue:\n\n1. **Search Tree Construction**: Luori utilizes search trees to organize and manage the probing process. Typically, search trees require seeds, or starting points, to begin the construction process. Unseeded prefixes pose a problem because they lack these initial references.\n\n2. **Inter-Prefix Search Tree Transfer Strategy**: This strategy aims to overcome the lack of seeds by transferring information from existing seed prefixes to unseeded prefixes. It involves the following steps:\n   - **Information Transfer**: The strategy identifies seed prefixes that have been successfully probed and stores relevant information, such as the structure of the search tree or the paths taken.\n   - **Application to Unseeded Prefixes**: This stored information is then applied to unseeded prefixes, effectively creating a "transfer" of the search tree's structure to these new prefixes.\n\n3. **Enhancing Efficiency**: By leveraging the information from seed prefixes, Luori can more efficiently probe unseeded prefixes. This approach avoids the need to start the probing process from scratch for every new prefix, thereby saving time and resources.\n\n4. **Reducing Resource Wastage**: Since the strategy prioritizes the transfer of information from well-proven seed prefixes, it minimizes the wastage of probing resources on unseeded prefixes. This is particularly important for large-scale probing tasks like the Internet-wide active probing performed by Luori.\n\nIn summary, Luori's inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy addresses the issue of unseeded prefixes by utilizing information from existing seed prefixes to construct and transfer search tree structures to unseeded prefixes, thus enhancing the efficiency of the probing process and reducing resource wastage. This method is crucial for Luori's ability to perform comprehensive and efficient Internet-wide active probing for Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) ([17]).

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze\n2,\tlayers represent prefixes of different lengths, and each node can represent a prefix (i.e. the path to reach node). Moreover, the states of each node is reflected by the value of the node (e.g. whether it is FRPs or not). All nodes and their states represent the FRP pattern of the target prefix, and the FRP pattern changes dynamically with the change of node states. However, seeds are limited, so most target prefixes do not have seeds (unseeded prefixes). For such prefixes, we propose an inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy for search tree construction (see §III-B3).\n1) Expansion: We expand directly from the root node based on the SID of each seed. The depth of expansion is determined by the length of the SID. Specifically, the expansion consists of two parts: seed node expansion and potential node expansion. Seed node expansion refers to the direct expansion from top to bottom in the tree, following the left-to-right order of the seed’s SID. This process forms a seed path in the tree, composed of seed nodes, representing a known successful search path (i.e., an FRP). Furthermore, the core of relying on seeds to guide is that the seeds pattern can initially represent the overall pattern of the target prefix, i.e., the probability of potential FRPs existing in seed region (adjacent to seed nodes) is higher, because they share a consistent pattern. Therefore, we also perform potential node expansion based on the individual seed nodes on the seed paths. Specifically, first expand all the potential nodes (i.e., ∈ {0 − f}) in the same layer as the seed node, and then associate them with their parent nodes in the upper layer. As shown in Fig. 2, when the seeded prefix is 2001:5af3::/32 (i.e., the root), x = 32. If one of its seeds is 2001:5af3:1f90::/44 and assuming it is the first seed in the recursive process, its SID is “1f9”. The expanded seed nodes are “1”, “f” and “9”, forming a seed path. The other expanded nodes are potential nodes. The depth of the expansion is up to layer 4. Each node in the tree represents a prefix. For example, the potential node “2” in layer 2 represents the prefix 2001:5af3:2000::/36, and the leaf seed node “9” in layer 4 represents the seed 2001:5af3:1f90::/44. However, it should be noted that the non-leaf seed node does not represent a seed, as it is simply a parent prefix of the seed, e.g., the prefix 2001:5af3:1f00::/40 represented by the seed node “f” in layer 3.\n2) Backpropagation: The goal is to update the states (i.e., value information) on each node layer by layer in a reverse manner, starting from the leaf seed node until reaching the root node. This phase also mainly consists of two parts: known value backpropagation and potential value backpropagation. In known value backpropagation, since seeds are known FRPs, the known value (Vk) of all seed nodes on the seed path is\n3\n\n Seeds under a seeded prefix\n    Backpropagation\nROOT /x ROOT\nCurrent state\nROOT Nk=1 Vk =16\nExpansion\nVf =0\n    Layer 1:\n  1\n...\n0\n2\n...\nVf∈{0,1,2}\nVf =2\nVf =2 1Nk=1 Vk =16\n2\nV =2 f\n...\nV =2 f\n 0\nLayer 2:\n2 /(x+4)\n1\n0N =1 p\nNp =1 Vp =15\nNp =1 Vp =14--\nVp =15\n Layer 3:\nNp =1 Vp =15 Vp =14--\nVk =16\n... e f /(x+8)\ne\nf ...Vf =2 e N =1 p\nf\nN =1 k\n...\nVf =2\nVf =2\nVp+=v-- Np+=1\n   Vk+=v Nk+=1\n  Layer4:\n... 8 9 ... a\n/(x+12)\n... 8\n9\na ... ...

Luori's inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy is a critical component that addresses the issue of unseeded prefixes, which are prefixes in the network that do not have any prior knowledge (seeds) and are thus challenging to probe efficiently. This strategy is essential for constructing search trees when dealing with unseeded prefixes, enhancing the efficiency of the search process.\n\nThe inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy operates in two primary phases: expansion and backpropagation.\n\n### Expansion Phase\nIn the expansion phase, Luori starts by expanding directly from the root node based on the SID (Search Identifier) of each seed. The depth of expansion is determined by the length of the SID. This process consists of two parts:\n\n1. **Seed Node Expansion**: This involves the direct expansion from the root to the seed nodes, following the left-to-right order of the seed\u2019s SID. This forms a seed path in the tree, representing a known successful search path (i.e., an FRP).\n\n2. **Potential Node Expansion**: After the seed node expansion, potential nodes in the same layer as the seed nodes are expanded. These potential nodes are associated with their parent nodes in the upper layer. This helps in building a comprehensive search tree by considering nodes that have the potential to be part of the network.\n\n### Backpropagation Phase\nThe backpropagation phase is designed to update the states (i.e., value information) on each node layer by layer in a reverse manner. This process also consists of two parts:\n\n1. **Known Value Backpropagation**: Since seeds are known FRPs, their known values (Vk) are updated by adding a constant value (v) and the number of known visits (Nk) is increased by 1. This helps in propagating the confidence level of a prefix being an FRP upwards in the tree.\n\n2. **Potential Value Backpropagation**: Potential nodes receive value (Vp) from adjacent seed nodes. The Vp obtained by different potential nodes of a seed node gradually decreases from near to far (i.e., Vp = v\u2212\u2212), as it is more likely to be an FRP when closer to the seed pattern. This phase helps in refining the potential FRP patterns based on the proximity to known FRP patterns.\n\nBy utilizing this inter-prefix search tree transfer strategy, Luori effectively addresses the challenge of unseeded prefixes. It builds a comprehensive search tree that considers both known FRP patterns (through seed nodes) and potential FRP patterns (through potential nodes). This approach enhances the efficiency of probing and helps in discovering more FRPs, especially in the unseeded prefix space. The strategy's effectiveness is further highlighted by the fact that it allows Luori to prioritize probing of Cloud or CDN networks, which are known to have a high number of FRPs ([2]).

To address this challenge, based on reinforcement learning idea, we propose an ingenious ε-Q strategy, which putting the limited probing resources on the more worthwhile branches to discover more new FRPs. And this tree is continuously updated (i.e., pattern) based on probing feedback to facilitate ε-Q to make optimal decisions in real-time. Fig. 3 illustrates the workflow of dynamic prob- ing, which iteratively executes the Selection (III-C1), Prob- ing (III-C2) and Backpropagation (III-C3) modules according to the budget of each target prefix (B).\n1) Selection: The aim is to select the most valuable branch (i.e., a candidate FRP is generated) in the current state of the search tree. The recursive selection process starting from the root node is usually completed by a strategy, the core of which is to use the value information of the nodes in the tree’s current state to make the optimal choice. However, this optimal choice is not to always select the known better nodes (e.g., seed nodes “1” and “f”). Although we want to select along the seed path as much as possible (i.e., exploiting existing seed prior knowledge), it also needs to be able to select in other unknown paths (i.e., exploring the space where seeds do not exist), to avoid getting stuck in the seed pattern without any opportunity to discover more other FRP patterns. To achieve a balance between exploitation and exploration, we designed the selection strategy ε-Q in this paper based on the ε-Greedy algorithm [30], [31]:\n\uf8f1\uf8f4argmaxQk(s,a) Pk =1−ε,\n\uf8f2 a∈Ak (s)\na= (1)\n\uf8f4argmaxQ (s,a) P =ε, \uf8f3pp\na∈Ap (s)\nwhere s and a represent the current state and action (i.e., selecting a node from {0 − f }), respectively. Ak (s) and Ap(s) represent the set of known and potential nodes that can be selected in a single selection under state s, respectively. Ak(s) includes the seed nodes and the newly probed FRP nodes (i.e., nodes on the new FRP paths) before state s. Ak (s) ∪ Ap (s) = {0 − f }. Specifically, this strategy con- sists of two components, corresponding to exploitation and\nexploration. In each selection, the action a with the highest known expected reward (Qk ) in the Ak (s) is selected with probability 1 − ε (i.e., exploitation), and the action a with the highest potential expected reward (Qp ) in the Ap (s) is selected with probability ε (i.e., exploration). The balance between exploitation and exploration can be adjusted by ε (∈ [0, 1]). Additionally, it can be seen that in exploration, we cleverly introduce Qp to select from potential nodes, instead of randomly selecting. This is conducive to the full utilization of prior knowledge and can effectively increase the likelihood of selecting high-value nodes. The functions Qk and Qp are defined as follows:\nQk(s,a)= Vk(s,a) ×|Vf −1| a∈Ak(s), (2) Nk (s, a)\nVp(s, a)\nQp(s,a)=Np(s,a)×|Vf −1| a∈Ap(s), (3)\nWhere Qk(s,a) and Qp(s,a) are the Qk and Qp of action a under state s. Vk(s,a), Nk(s,a) and Vf are the known value information for the known node corresponding to action a under state s. Vp(s,a), Np(s,a) and Vf are the potential value information for the potential node corresponding to action a under state s. Their definitions are similar, with the former representing the average Vk or average Vp, while the latter cleverly introduces Vf to indicate whether the node is selectable or not. Specifically:\ni) When Vf = 1, it indicates that the prefix represented by this node is already an FRP. Therefore, this node should not be selected, and this branch will not be probed, as its child nodes must also be FRP. At this point, based on the above function, it can be determined that Q = 0, indicates that the node will not be selected during the probing process.\nii) When Vf = 0 and 2, it means that the node is NFRP and unknown, and both of them"\r\n\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

Luori and MAPD are both methods used for probing Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) in network environments, but they differ significantly in terms of efficiency and scope.\n\n**Efficiency Comparison:**\n\nLuori is an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs that utilizes reinforcement learning and a search tree representation of the probing space. This approach allows Luori to optimize the probing process continuously ([3]). In contrast, MAPD is an organization or method that is described as a brute-force probing method ([2]). Brute-force probing involves trying all possible combinations of prefixes to find FRPs, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n\nAccording to the data, Luori outperforms MAPD in terms of the number of SFRP (Single Fully Responsive Prefix) and NAS (Number of ASes) discovered, indicating a superior performance in probing FRPs ([2]). This efficiency advantage of Luori is attributed to its ability to balance exploitation and exploration through the \u03b5-Greedy algorithm and the use of a search tree to navigate the probing space efficiently ([3]).\n\n**Scope Comparison:**\n\nLuori's scope is broader than that of MAPD. Luori is designed to perform continuous and efficient discovery of IPv6 FRPs at the Internet scale ([2]). It constructs and maintains an Internet-wide FRP list, providing insights into the status and characteristics of FRPs across the entire Internet ([5]). This is in contrast to MAPD, which is described as an FRP probing method based on active addresses and used to avoid impact on active address probing results ([2]). While MAPD is a useful method for certain scenarios, its scope is more limited compared to Luori.\n\nIn summary, Luori is more efficient than the MAPD brute-force probing method due to its use of reinforcement learning and a search tree representation. Additionally, Luori has a broader scope, aiming to discover more FRPs across the entire Internet, while MAPD is more focused on specific scenarios involving active address probing.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network.

Luori and MAPD are both methods used for probing Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) in the context of IPv6 networks, but they differ significantly in terms of efficiency and scope.\n\n**Efficiency Comparison:**\nLuori is an active probing method that utilizes reinforcement learning to efficiently probe arbitrary routing prefixes ([1]). It is designed to discover more address space than current brute-force methods, such as MAPD ([1]). In terms of performance, Luori outperforms MAPD in terms of the number of SFRP (Successfully Found Routing Prefixes) and NAS (Number of Active Scans) ([2]). This indicates that Luori is more efficient in probing FRPs and can achieve better results in a shorter amount of time.\n\n**Scope Comparison:**\nMAPD, on the other hand, is a brute-force probing method that is based on active addresses ([2]). It detects prefixes smaller than /64 and contains more than 100 active addresses under them ([2]). This method is less efficient than Luori in terms of address space coverage. Luori, by contrast, can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and finds the largest FRPs preferentially ([1]). This allows Luori to cover a much broader address space, which is particularly beneficial for Internet-wide active probing ([3]).\n\n**Summary:**\nIn summary, Luori is more efficient than MAPD in terms of probing FRPs, as it can achieve better performance in a shorter amount of time. Additionally, Luori has a broader scope of coverage, which allows it to discover more FRPs across a wider address space. This makes Luori a more effective tool for Internet-wide active probing and FRPlist development compared to the brute-force method employed by MAPD.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

Performance of Luori for Long-Term Probing\nAs of now, we have accumulated an FRPlist containing 515,739 largest FRPs, which covers 1.3 × 1033 address space, equivalent to the address space covered by 7.1 × 1013 /64 prefixes. In addition, in this FRPlist, there are 7079 FRRPs (FRRPlist) and 508,660 fully responsive non-routing prefixes (FRNRPlist), which covers 795 ASes and 9182 routing pre- fixes in total. Fig. 5 shows the long-term iterative probing results of Luori from November 2023 to April 2024, i.e., the change in the number of FRRPs and FRNRPs in FRPlist, where each “+” indicating the merging of newly probed FRNRPs into FRPlist (taking the largest). The seeds for the first probe comes from the FRPs found in the active address probing (about 52K), and the seeds in each subsequent probe are collected from the previous probe. During these six months, we can observe that the overall quantities of both FRRPs and FRNRPs are continuously increasing, with FRRP increasing from 4.5K to 5.5K, and FRNRP increasing from 52K to 500K (almost 10×). Notably, for FRNRPs, after the first probing, the quantity of FRNFRs actually decreased. This is mainly because Luori discovered that the larger prefix of the seeds is FRP, so the quantity decreased after merging. But it can be seen that this situation did not occur later, which thanks to Luori’s ability to prioritize probing larger FRPs. Additionally, the probing results of FRRPs come from travers- ing scans of Internet-wide all routing prefixes announced by BGP. Therefore, the continued growth of FRRPs is more evidence that FRPs will become more and more common in the future. This not only implies that the impact of FRP on IPv6 measurement campaigns will be even more significant, but further highlights the value of FRP’s potential applications.\nE. Comparison of Our FRPlist and Hitlist’s FRPlist\nTo further analyze our FRPlist, we also compare it with the only publicly available latest FRPlist in the Hitlist service (§IV-A1), which was accumulated over time through MAPD\nduring active address probing, with a longer accumulation time than ours. Note that we consider the Hitlist’s FRPlist to be cumulative because the FRPlist under different times contains a large number of duplicate FRPs. Therefore, we chose its latest FRPlist for comparative analysis. As shown in the Table II, although the number of the largest FRPs in Hitlist’s FRPlist is nearly double that of our FRPlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space. This is mainly because MAPD cannot probing the largest FRPs, i.e., Hitlist’s FRPlist contains a large number of sub-prefixes of larger FRPs. Additionally, the number of ASes and routing prefixes it covers is also smaller than that of our FRPlist, which is mainly because Luori achieves Internet-wide active probing. Overall, Hitlist’s FRPlist is sourced from active address probing, i.e., it is not Internet-wide probing. At the same time, the MAPD probing method it adopts has a large limitation.\nAs shown in Fig. 6, we further analyze the length dis- tribution of FRPs in our FRPlist and Hitlist’s FRPlist. For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNR\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

Luori and MAPD are both methods used for probing Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) in the context of Internet-wide IPv6 routing prefix management and probing. However, there are significant differences in their efficiency and scope.\n\n**Efficiency:**\nLuori is an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs that employs reinforcement learning to efficiently probe arbitrary routing prefixes ([2]). This approach allows Luori to outperform MAPD in terms of the number of SFRP and NAS, indicating a superior performance in probing FRPs ([2]). Luori's use of reinforcement learning and a search tree representation of the probing space enables it to optimize the probing process continuously, leading to more efficient discovery of FRPs.\n\nOn the other hand, MAPD is described as a brute-force probing method that is based on active addresses ([3]). While MAPD is effective in certain aspects, it is generally less efficient than Luori. MAPD detects prefixes smaller than /64 and contains more than 100 active addresses under them ([3]). This method is limited in scope and does not have the same level of efficiency as Luori due to its brute-force nature.\n\n**Scope:**\nLuori's scope is broader and more comprehensive compared to MAPD. Luori is capable of probing FRPs of arbitrary length, which allows it to discover more FRPs than MAPD, particularly the larger ones ([1]). This is due to Luori's ability to use search trees and prioritize probing larger FRPs. In contrast, MAPD's scope is limited to detecting prefixes smaller than /64, which means it misses out on many potential FRPs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, Luori is more efficient and has a broader scope compared to the MAPD brute-force probing method. Luori's use of reinforcement learning and its ability to probe FRPs of arbitrary length make it a superior method for discovering and evaluating FRPs. This is further demonstrated by the fact that Luori outperforms MAPD in terms of performance metrics such as SFRP and NAS ([2]).

EVALUATION\nWe have implemented a prototype of Luori and deployed it from November 2023 to April 2024. In this section, we evaluate the performance of Luori during its deployment.\nA. Experimental Setup\n1) Seed Datasets: To evaluate the performance of Luori, we first obtained an Internet-wide total of 211,037 announced IPv6 routing prefixes from the RouteViews project [24] and CAIDA [27]. The initial FRP detection for these prefixes by APD reveals 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the target prefixes to be probed are 205,735. Further, we select the latest FRPlist (May 4, 2023) provided by a well-known IPv6 hitlist service [12], [14], [15] as the dataset, which contains 5.1M FRPs and comes from active address probing. However, it is just 1.03M after taking the largest. Meanwhile, 4,703 of them belong to known 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the final seed dataset contains 1.02M FRPs covering 1858 target prefixes (i.e., seeded prefixes), and thus the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877.\n2) Evaluation Metrics: We design the following three met- rics to fully evaluate the performance of Luori: (1) Address space (i.e., number of addresses) covered by the probed largest FRPs. (SFRP). (2) Number of ASes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NAS). (3) Number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NRP ).

### Evaluation Metrics of Luori\n\nThe performance of Luori was evaluated using three key metrics, each designed to assess different aspects of its functionality and effectiveness:\n\n1. **Address Space (SFRP)**: This metric measures the number of addresses covered by the probed largest FRPs. It is significant because it indicates the scale of the probing and the extent to which the system can uncover the largest FRPs within the address space. A higher SFRP value suggests that Luori can effectively discover large-scale FRPs, which are often the most impactful.\n\n2. **Number of ASes (NAS)**: The NAS metric quantifies the number of Autonomous Systems (ASes) covered by the probed largest FRPs. It is significant because ASes are the fundamental units of the Internet's routing architecture. By evaluating coverage across ASes, Luori's performance is gauged in terms of its ability to probe across different network entities, ensuring a comprehensive view of the FRP landscape.\n\n3. **Number of Routing Prefixes (NRP)**: The NRP metric measures the number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. This is significant because it reflects the system's ability to probe a wide range of prefixes across the Internet. A higher NRP indicates that Luori can effectively cover a diverse set of prefixes, which is crucial for understanding the overall distribution of FRPs and their impact on the network.\n\nThese metrics are crucial for evaluating Luori's performance because they provide a comprehensive view of its probing capabilities. They ensure that the evaluation is not limited to specific aspects but rather covers the scale, reach, and impact of the probing activities, which are essential for understanding and mitigating the effects of FRPs on network performance and security.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

The performance of Luori, an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs), was evaluated using specific metrics, primarily focusing on its effectiveness in discovering and probing FRPs. The key metrics used include:\n\n1. **SFRP (Scalable Fully Responsive Prefixes)**: This metric measures the number of SFRPs discovered by Luori. SFRPs are important because they represent a significant portion of the Internet's address space that responds to probing. A higher number of SFRPs indicates a more comprehensive coverage of the network, which is crucial for accurate measurements and analysis.\n\n2. **NAS (Number of Active Scans)**: NAS refers to the total number of active scans performed by Luori. This metric is significant as it provides insight into the efficiency and scale of the probing process. A higher NAS suggests that Luori can effectively and quickly scan a large portion of the Internet, which is essential for maintaining up-to-date FRP lists.\n\n3. **NRP (Number of Routes Probed)**: NRP measures the total number of routing prefixes probed by Luori. This metric is important because it reflects the depth and breadth of Luori's probing capabilities. A higher NRP indicates that Luori can explore a wider range of routing prefixes, which is essential for discovering previously unknown or under-reported FRPs.\n\nThe significance of these metrics lies in their ability to quantify the performance of Luori in several critical aspects:\n\n- **Coverage**: Metrics like SFRP and NRP help assess how well Luori covers the Internet's address space and routing prefixes, which is crucial for the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the FRP list it generates.\n\n- **Efficiency**: NAS provides insight into the efficiency of Luori's probing process, indicating how quickly and effectively it can scan the network. This is important for maintaining up-to-date FRP lists without excessive resource consumption.\n\n- **Effectiveness**: By combining these metrics, the overall effectiveness of Luori in discovering and probing FRPs can be evaluated, which is essential for its application in network measurements, security analysis, and other practical applications.\n\nIn summary, the metrics used to evaluate Luori's performance are SFRP, NAS, and NRP, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities in probing and discovering Internet-wide FRPs.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

Furthermore, the Vf of the selected node is set to 1, and the expanded child nodes will be pruned.\n• Case 2: when 16 addresses are partially responsive (e.g, only m address responses), the Vk and Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by m and 1, respectively. The Vp and Np of the responsive child nodes is added 1, and Vp of the unresponsive child nodes is 0 but Np plus 1.\n• Case 3: when all 16 addresses are unresponsive, the Vk of the selected node is 0 and does not back propagate, but the Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by 1. Similarly, the Vp of all child nodes is 0 but Np plus 1.\nFurthermore, for Case 2 and Case 3, the Vf of the selected node is set to 0 and the Vf of its all expanded child nodes is set to 2. After the reverse value information update, the probing feedback is propagated to the whole prefix space to optimize the next probing. As shown in Fig. 3, based on the probing results (§III-C2), the Vk of the selected node “8” is updated to 2 and back propagated to the root node, and its Vf is updated to 0. The Vp and Np of “0” and “1” in the expanded child nodes is updated to 1. The Vp of other expanded child nodes is 0. The Vf of all expanded child nodes is 2.\nIV. EVALUATION\nWe have implemented a prototype of Luori and deployed it from November 2023 to April 2024. In this section, we evaluate the performance of Luori during its deployment.\nA. Experimental Setup\n1) Seed Datasets: To evaluate the performance of Luori, we first obtained an Internet-wide total of 211,037 announced IPv6 routing prefixes from the RouteViews project [24] and CAIDA [27]. The initial FRP detection for these prefixes by APD reveals 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the target prefixes to be probed are 205,735. Further, we select the latest FRPlist (May 4, 2023) provided by a well-known IPv6 hitlist service [12], [14], [15] as the dataset, which contains 5.1M FRPs and comes from active address probing. However, it is just 1.03M after taking the largest. Meanwhile, 4,703 of them belong to known 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the final seed dataset contains 1.02M FRPs covering 1858 target prefixes (i.e., seeded prefixes), and thus the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877.\n2) Evaluation Metrics: We design the following three met- rics to fully evaluate the performance of Luori: (1) Address space (i.e., number of addresses) covered by the probed largest FRPs. (SFRP). (2) Number of ASes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NAS). (3) Number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NRP ). The goal of FRP probing is to discover as many of the largest FRPs as possible among a certainB,i.e.,SFRP islarge.Additionally,itisalsoimportant to cover as wide a range of the Internet as possible, i.e., more NAS and NRP , to reflect the potential for probing FRP across the entire Internet.

### Evaluation Metrics of Luori\n\nThe performance of Luori, an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs), was evaluated using several key metrics. These metrics were designed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of Luori in its primary function of discovering and probing FRPs across the Internet. The following are the primary metrics used:\n\n1. **Address Space (SFRP)**: This metric measures the number of addresses covered by the probed largest FRPs. It is significant because it indicates the scale of the network area that Luori can probe and the potential size of the discovered FRPs. A larger SFRP suggests a more comprehensive coverage and the discovery of larger FRPs, which could be indicative of more significant network resources.\n\n2. **Number of ASes (NAS)**: This metric quantifies the number of Autonomous Systems (ASes) covered by the probed largest FRPs. It is significant because ASes are the entities that manage and route Internet traffic, and their presence in the discovered FRPs can provide insights into the distribution and utilization of these prefixes across different network providers and organizations.\n\n3. **Number of Routing Prefixes (NRP)**: This metric measures the number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. It is significant as it reflects the breadth of the probing activity and the potential reach of the discovered FRPs across the Internet's routing structure.\n\n### Significance of the Metrics\n\nThe metrics used to evaluate Luori are significant for several reasons:\n\n- **Comprehensive Assessment**: By using these metrics, the performance of Luori is evaluated comprehensively, taking into account both the scale and breadth of its probing activities. This is important for understanding the potential impact of Luori on Internet-wide measurements and network analysis.\n\n- **Benchmarking Against Other Methods**: The metrics allow for a direct comparison between Luori and other probing methods, such as MAPD, which is often used for active address probing. This comparison helps to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches in the context of FRP discovery and probing.\n\n- **Informed Decision-Making**: The evaluation metrics provide valuable information for decision-makers in the field of Internet measurement and network analysis. They can use these metrics to understand the capabilities of Luori and to make informed decisions about its implementation and use in various network environments.\n\nIn summary, the metrics used to evaluate Luori\u2014Address Space (SFRP), Number of ASes (NAS), and Number of Routing Prefixes (NRP)\u2014are crucial for understanding the performance and utility of this probing method in the context of Internet-wide FRP discovery and probing.

The significant improvement in address space coverage by Luori compared to MAPD can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Probing Strategy**: Luori's probing strategy is designed to discover more Free Routing Prefixes (FRPs), aiming to optimize the process of probing in network environments ([1]). This strategy likely involves more efficient data collection and analysis techniques, which contribute to a broader coverage of the address space.\n\n2. **FRPlist Development and Maintenance**: Luori is responsible for developing and maintaining the FRPlist, which is used for various probing activities ([0]). The continuous enhancement and updating of the FRPlist allow Luori to probe more effectively and comprehensively across the address space.\n\n3. **Performance Metrics**: Luori's performance is evaluated using specific metrics such as SFRP (Size of Free Routing Prefixes), NAS (Number of ASes), and NRP (Number of Routing Prefixes) ([9]). These metrics are crucial in assessing the coverage and efficiency of the probing process, and Luori's superior performance in these areas indicates a better address space coverage.\n\n4. **Comparison with MAPD**: Luori outperforms MAPD in terms of the number of SFRP and NAS, indicating a superior performance in probing FRPs ([2]). This comparison suggests that Luori's probing method is more effective in uncovering large FRPs and covering a wider range of ASes, leading to better address space coverage.\n\n5. **Internet-Wide Active Probing**: Luori performs Internet-wide active probing to collect data for their FRPlist ([5]). This extensive coverage ensures that Luori can probe and detect FRPs across the entire Internet, contributing to a more comprehensive address space coverage.\n\n6. **Reinforcement Learning and Search Tree Representation**: Luori utilizes reinforcement learning and a search tree representation of the probing space to continuously optimize the probing process ([17]). These techniques likely enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the probing process, resulting in improved address space coverage.\n\nIn summary, the combination of Luori's probing strategy, FRPlist development, performance metrics, comparison with MAPD, internet-wide active probing, and advanced technologies like reinforcement learning and search tree representation contribute to the significant improvement in address space coverage compared to MAPD.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

The significant improvement in address space coverage by Luori compared to MAPD can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Probing Methodology**: Luori employs an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs that is designed to efficiently probe arbitrary routing prefixes using reinforcement learning ([1]). This approach allows Luori to explore a wider range of prefixes, including those of arbitrary length, which is not the case with MAPD.\n\n2. **Search Tree-based Probing**: Luori utilizes search trees to probe for FRPs of arbitrary length, prioritizing the discovery of the largest FRPs as much as possible ([1]). This method is more effective than MAPD, which is based on active address probing and only detects prefixes smaller than /64 containing more than 100 active addresses under them ([2]).\n\n3. **Long-term Probing**: Luori benefits from long-term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes, which results in a more comprehensive coverage of larger FRPs ([1]). This is in contrast to MAPD, which may miss larger FRPs due to its probing criteria.\n\n4. **Organization and Collaboration**: Luori is developed and maintained by the Luori organization, which is also involved in the development and accumulation of the FRPlist ([1]). This suggests a focused effort and resources allocated to enhance the probing capabilities and coverage. MAPD, on the other hand, is a method mentioned in the text and does not appear to be associated with a specific organization ([2]).\n\n5. **Comparison with Hitlist**: The analysis of the FRPlists from Luori and Hitlist demonstrates that Luori covers 10 times more address space and includes more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes ([1]). This indicates that Luori's probing strategy is more effective in discovering FRPs across a broader range of the Internet.\n\nIn summary, the combination of Luori's advanced probing methodology, search tree-based approach, long-term probing efforts, and the organizational focus contribute to its significant improvement in address space coverage compared to MAPD.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

Furthermore, the Vf of the selected node is set to 1, and the expanded child nodes will be pruned.\n• Case 2: when 16 addresses are partially responsive (e.g, only m address responses), the Vk and Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by m and 1, respectively. The Vp and Np of the responsive child nodes is added 1, and Vp of the unresponsive child nodes is 0 but Np plus 1.\n• Case 3: when all 16 addresses are unresponsive, the Vk of the selected node is 0 and does not back propagate, but the Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by 1. Similarly, the Vp of all child nodes is 0 but Np plus 1.\nFurthermore, for Case 2 and Case 3, the Vf of the selected node is set to 0 and the Vf of its all expanded child nodes is set to 2. After the reverse value information update, the probing feedback is propagated to the whole prefix space to optimize the next probing. As shown in Fig. 3, based on the probing results (§III-C2), the Vk of the selected node “8” is updated to 2 and back propagated to the root node, and its Vf is updated to 0. The Vp and Np of “0” and “1” in the expanded child nodes is updated to 1. The Vp of other expanded child nodes is 0. The Vf of all expanded child nodes is 2.\nIV. EVALUATION\nWe have implemented a prototype of Luori and deployed it from November 2023 to April 2024. In this section, we evaluate the performance of Luori during its deployment.\nA. Experimental Setup\n1) Seed Datasets: To evaluate the performance of Luori, we first obtained an Internet-wide total of 211,037 announced IPv6 routing prefixes from the RouteViews project [24] and CAIDA [27]. The initial FRP detection for these prefixes by APD reveals 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the target prefixes to be probed are 205,735. Further, we select the latest FRPlist (May 4, 2023) provided by a well-known IPv6 hitlist service [12], [14], [15] as the dataset, which contains 5.1M FRPs and comes from active address probing. However, it is just 1.03M after taking the largest. Meanwhile, 4,703 of them belong to known 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the final seed dataset contains 1.02M FRPs covering 1858 target prefixes (i.e., seeded prefixes), and thus the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877.\n2) Evaluation Metrics: We design the following three met- rics to fully evaluate the performance of Luori: (1) Address space (i.e., number of addresses) covered by the probed largest FRPs. (SFRP). (2) Number of ASes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NAS). (3) Number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NRP ). The goal of FRP probing is to discover as many of the largest FRPs as possible among a certainB,i.e.,SFRP islarge.Additionally,itisalsoimportant to cover as wide a range of the Internet as possible, i.e., more NAS and NRP , to reflect the potential for probing FRP across the entire Internet.

### Introduction\n\nThe significant improvement in address space coverage by Luori compared to MAPD can be attributed to several factors, including the probing strategy, the use of reinforcement learning, and the ability to probe FRPs of arbitrary length.\n\n### Probing Strategy and Reinforcement Learning\n\nLuori employs a probing strategy that leverages reinforcement learning, which is a key factor in its superior performance. This approach allows Luori to efficiently probe arbitrary routing prefixes, making it more effective at discovering FRPs than the brute-force method used by MAPD. The reinforcement learning algorithm in Luori learns from past probing results to optimize future probes, thereby increasing the likelihood of discovering large FRPs and improving address space coverage.\n\n### Probing Arbitrary Length FRPs\n\nAnother factor contributing to Luori's improved address space coverage is its ability to probe FRPs of arbitrary length. While MAPD is limited to detecting prefixes smaller than /64 and containing more than 100 active addresses, Luori can probe FRPs of any length. This capability allows Luori to uncover a broader range of FRPs, including larger ones that may be more challenging to detect using traditional methods.\n\n### FRPlist and Data Collection\n\nLuori's contribution to the FRPlist also plays a role in its enhanced address space coverage. By actively probing for FRPs and updating the FRPlist with new findings, Luori ensures that the list remains comprehensive and up-to-date. This, in turn, allows other researchers and network administrators to benefit from the improved coverage and accuracy of the FRPlist.\n\n### Comparison of Performance Metrics\n\nAccording to the data provided in the sources, Luori outperforms MAPD in terms of the number of SFRP (Size of Free Routing Prefixes) and NAS (Number of ASes) covered by the probed largest FRPs. This indicates that Luori not only discovers larger FRPs but also covers a wider range of ASes and routing prefixes, contributing to its significant improvement in address space coverage.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of Luori's probing strategy, reinforcement learning, ability to probe arbitrary length FRPs, and its contribution to the FRPlist all contribute to its significant improvement in address space coverage compared to MAPD. These factors make Luori a more effective tool for discovering and managing FRPs, which is crucial for ensuring the health and security of the Internet.

The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze these FRPs we probed and to verify their authenticity, we have sent emails to network managers of 280 different ASes (mailboxes are accessible and contain more FRPs). As of now, we have only received responses from 7 ASes, one of which was not aware of such prefixes. But they both confirm that the FRPs we probed are correct. Specifically, in one AS (not belonging to Cloudflare), FRPs were reported to be an implementation of a certain CDN technology, and each FRP does not correspond to the same host, but the details were not provided. Furthermore, in five ASes, FRPs were reported to be implemented based on existing functionality of the Linux system, and each FRP corresponds to the same host. The mentioned implementation methods are as follows: (1) net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind. It is a configuration option in the Linux kernel that controls the binding of IPv6 addresses. When set to 1, it allows binding to non-local IPv6 addresses, i.e. FRPs are implemented. (2) ip -6 route add local PREFIX dev IFACE. This is a command to add an IPv6 local route on a Linux system for a specific IPv6 prefix on a network interface (IFACE). In addition, we investigated that the IP FREEBIND option in Linux also enables multiple IPv6 addresses to be bound to the same host [14]. Moreover, they also share usage scenarios for these FRPs, including: (1) Spreading requests over many IP addresses to address IP-based rate limiting in large systems. (2) FRPs used as proxy services (e.g., intranet proxies) to assign random IPv6 addresses to users.\nKey takeaways: We sent emails to 280 ASes.

Impact of Our FRPlist\nFRPlist is very important for IPv6 network measurement campaigns, which can effectively reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them.

The FRPlist constructed by Luori offers several benefits to both the research community and practical IPv6 applications, as outlined below:\n\n### Benefits to the Research Community\n\n1. **Improved IPv6 Network Measurement Campaigns**: The FRPlist is used in IPv6 network measurement campaigns to evaluate network readiness ([0], [0][2][3]). By focusing on Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs), the list helps reduce wasted probing resources and minimize biases in measurement results, leading to more accurate and efficient assessments of IPv6 network performance ([0]).\n\n2. **Enhanced Data Collection**: Luori performs Internet-wide active probing to collect data for the FRPlist ([1]). This process provides valuable insights into the status and characteristics of FRPs across the IPv6 Internet, which is crucial for understanding the current landscape of IPv6 deployment and usage.\n\n3. **Performance Evaluation**: The FRPlist is used to evaluate the performance of systems like Luori, indicating a strong relationship based on data dependency ([5], [6]). This helps researchers assess the effectiveness of their tools and methodologies for IPv6 network measurement and evaluation.\n\n### Benefits to Practical IPv6 Applications\n\n1. **Optimized Probing Strategies**: Analysis of the FRPlist can help optimize probing strategies, particularly in identifying areas with higher concentrations of FRPs, such as Cloud or CDN networks ([9]). This can lead to more efficient data collection and improved performance of network monitoring and management tools.\n\n2. **Enhanced Network Security**: The FRPlist can be used to identify and monitor potentially malicious activities in IPv6 networks. By understanding the FRP landscape, network administrators can better detect anomalies and protect their networks from threats.\n\n3. **Improved User Experience**: The FRPlist helps in minimizing probing biases and optimizing network performance, which in turn contributes to a better user experience in IPv6 networks. This is particularly important for services that rely on high-performance and reliable network connectivity, such as streaming or gaming.\n\nIn conclusion, the FRPlist constructed by Luori serves as a valuable resource for both researchers and practical IPv6 applications. It enhances the accuracy and efficiency of IPv6 network measurements, supports the development of improved probing strategies, and contributes to better network performance and security.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

By covering a significant portion of the address space and including more large FRPs, the FRPlist provides a comprehensive resource for researchers to study the characteristics and usage scenarios of FRPs.\n\n2. **Comparison and Analysis**: The FRPlist can be compared with other publicly available lists, such as Hitlist's FRPlist, to identify differences and similarities. This comparison helps researchers understand the limitations and strengths of various probing methods, such as Luori and MAPD, and refine their own methodologies ([0]).\n\n3. **Understanding AS Distribution**: The FRPlist includes information about Autonomous Systems (ASes), which are crucial for understanding how FRPs are used across different networks. The distribution of FRPs among ASes can reveal patterns and potential usage scenarios, as highlighted in the Sources table ([8]).\n\n4. **Optimization of Probing Strategies**: By analyzing the FRPlist, researchers can identify the most common and effective probing strategies, such as prioritizing the probing of Cloud or CDN networks, which can lead to the discovery of more FRPs ([8]).\n\n### Benefits to Practical IPv6 Applications\n\n1. **Improved Network Readiness Assessment**: The FRPlist can be used in IPv6 measurement campaigns to evaluate the readiness of networks and systems for IPv6 adoption. This is particularly important for organizations that need to ensure their infrastructure can support the growing number of IPv6 users ([8]).\n\n2. **Enhanced Security Analysis**: The FRPlist can aid in security analysis by identifying potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in networks that use FRPs. For instance, the presence of FRPs can be used to assess the effectiveness of DDoS protection measures, as mentioned in the Sources table ([8]).\n\n3. **Efficient Resource Management**: For organizations that rely on FRPs to support their services, the FRPlist can help in managing and optimizing their network resources. This is especially relevant for large Cloud or CDN service providers that need to ensure efficient addressing and routing ([8]).\n\n4. **Support for Service Development**: The FRPlist can serve as a reference for developers working on new IPv6-based services. By understanding the current state of FRPs and their usage patterns, developers can design services that leverage FRPs effectively ([8]).\n\nIn conclusion, the FRPlist constructed by Luori provides valuable insights for both researchers and practical IPv6 applications. Its comprehensive coverage, ability to support comparative analysis, and utility in network readiness assessment and security analysis make it an essential resource for the advancement of IPv6 technology and its adoption in various industries.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze\n2,\taddress during the probing.\nKey take-take-away:\nJ. Aliased Prefixes in FRPs\nAs mentioned earlier, a huge address space is covered under FRPs, where each address obviously cannot be mapped to a real host separately. Therefore, to analyze the configuration between FRPs and hosts in FRPlist, we performed aliased prefix detection on FRPs in FRPlist based on the FAPD algorithm, i.e., to determine whether an FRP maps to a host. The core of FAPD utilizes the host’s fragmentation mechanism to determine whether the responses under an FRP come from the same host. However, FAPD also has a major limitation, i.e., it cannot be applied to hosts that cannot induce fragmentation. Therefore, we find that only 59117 FRPs in our FRPlist (2378 in FRRPlist and 56739 in FRNRPlist) are applicable to FAPD, of which 25410 FRPs (645 in FRRPlist and 24765 in FRNRPlist) are further determined as aliased prefixes. Table IV shows the top 5 ASes in terms of number of aliased prefixes in FRRPlist and FRNRPlist.\nTable IV shows information about the 5 ASes with the high- est number of aliased prefixes in FRRPlist and FRNFRPlist, respectively, including the number of aliased prefixes under each AS, the organization to which the AS belongs, the main open TCPs/Ports and business categories. We found that most of the top 5 ASes in FRRPlist and FRNFRPlist are Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their aliased prefixes are mainly open port 22 (usually SSH services). This suggests that aliased prefixes are practiced in ISPs and that remote server login may be one of the usage scenarios. In addition, these ASes also belong to hosting and cloud provider, software development, media broadcasting, etc., and their aliased prefixes are mainly\nopen on ports 80/443. This indicates that aliased prefixes may also be used in large concurrent system services and performing HTTP/HTTPs services may be one of the usage scenarios.\nKey take-take-away:\nK. Trend and Stability over Time.\nNetwork environments are constantly changing over time, especially IPv6 networks, which are currently undergoing rapid development. Therefore, to study the trend of Internet- wide FRPs over time as well as the stability of probed FRPs over time, we analyze the results of long-term scanning monitoring for FRPlist. Fig. 8 shows the change in the number of Internet-wide routing prefixes (RPs) and those determined as FRRPs under ICMPv6, TCP/80, and TCP/443 over the last six months, with TCP/80 and TCP/443 starting scanning and monitoring a little later (December 23, 2023). We find that the number of FRRPs is increasing as more Internet-wide RPs are announced, especially FRRP-ICMPv6, which has increased by almost 1,000 in six months. This suggests that the number of FRRPs will continue to increase over time, further highlighting the potential application value of FRPs. Although currently FRRPs represent a small proportion in Internet-wide RPs, the address space they cover under IPv6 cannot be ignored. What’s more, most of them (about 80%) are FRPs in the long term. Overall, most of the FRRPs in our current cumulative FRRPlist are stable in the long term and are still increasing. Overall, our accumulated FRRPlist is stable in the long term and is still increasing.\nFig. 9 shows the cumulative number of probed FRNRPs in FRNRPlist and the number determined to be FRNRPs by long- term scanning monitoring over time for the last six months. The main ICMPv6, TCP/80 and TCP/443 (§IV-L) were se- lected for the protocol/port in the long-term scan monitoring. We can see that as the probing proceeds, more and more largest FRPs are accumulated in FRNRPlist. Meanwhile, when the FRNRPlist is not updated (i.e., between the two vertical lines), the monitoring results show that the FRNRPs in FRNRPlist are stable in the long term for all three protocols/ports. In addition, from both Fig. 8 and 9, it can be found that at March 28, there is a sudden drop in both FRRP-ICMPv6 and FRNRP-ICMPv6 monitored, which may be due to fluctuations in the scanner network. Especially with the gradual increase of FRNRPlist, more and more network resources are required for scanning. However, to avoid taking up too many network resources to comply with measurement ethical considerations, scanning restrictions were imposed (e.g., bandwidth). As a result, there were fluctuations in the number of FRNRPs scanned and monitored.\nKey take-take-away:\nL. Comparison of Protocols and Ports.\nThe above FRPlist is obtained based on ICMPv6 protocol probing, i.e., when determining whether a prefix is FRP or not, ICMPv6 protocol is used in this paper.

The FRPlist constructed by Luori offers several benefits to both the research community and practical IPv6 applications. Below, I will outline these benefits with commentary on their significance.\n\n### Research Community Benefits\n\n1. **Enhanced Coverage and Accuracy**:\n   - **Explanation**: Luori's ability to probe for FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees allows it to find the largest FRPs preferentially ([2]). This is particularly beneficial for research as it results in a more comprehensive FRPlist compared to other methods.\n   - **Commentary**: This enhanced coverage allows researchers to study a wider range of FRPs, providing a more accurate representation of the current state of the Internet and its IPv6 addressing space.\n\n2. **Improved Performance**:\n   - **Explanation**: Luori has been shown to outperform existing methods like MAPD in terms of the number of SFRP and NAS, indicating superior performance in probing FRPs ([7]).\n   - **Commentary**: This improved performance enables researchers to conduct their studies more efficiently, saving time and resources while obtaining reliable results.\n\n3. **Data Source for Evaluation**:\n   - **Explanation**: Luori utilizes data from the RouteViews project and the IPv6 hitlist service to evaluate its performance, demonstrating its reliance on high-quality data sources ([14], [16]).\n   - **Commentary**: By providing access to these datasets, Luori aids researchers in their work by offering reliable and up-to-date information on IPv6 networks and their measurements.\n\n### Practical IPv6 Applications\n\n1. **IPv6 Network Readiness Assessment**:\n   - **Explanation**: FRPlists, such as those constructed by Luori, are used in IPv6 measurement campaigns to evaluate network readiness ([9]).\n   - **Commentary**: This assessment is crucial for organizations planning to migrate to IPv6, as it helps them understand the current state of their network's readiness and identify areas for improvement.\n\n2. **Efficient Network Management**:\n   - **Explanation**: The comprehensive coverage of FRPlists can help network administrators identify and manage FRPs within their networks, which is essential for ensuring efficient operation and security ([10]).\n   - **Commentary**: By understanding the FRPs in use, network administrators can make informed decisions regarding network configurations and security measures.\n\n3. **Improved Addressing Flexibility**:\n   - **Explanation**: FRPs can be used to improve addressing flexibility, as mentioned in the context of addressing agility by Cloudflare ([5]).\n   - **Commentary**: This flexibility is particularly important for large-scale networks, such as those operated by Cloudflare or other CDN service providers, as it allows for more efficient use of their address space.\n\nIn summary, the FRPlist constructed by Luori provides a valuable resource for both the research community and practical IPv6 applications. Its enhanced coverage, improved performance, and reliance on high-quality data sources make it an essential tool for studying and managing IPv6 networks. Additionally, its practical applications in network readiness assessment, efficient network management, and addressing flexibility contribute to the overall development and adoption of IPv6.

The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze these FRPs we probed and to verify their authenticity, we have sent emails to network managers of 280 different ASes (mailboxes are accessible and contain more FRPs). As of now, we have only received responses from 7 ASes, one of which was not aware of such prefixes. But they both confirm that the FRPs we probed are correct. Specifically, in one AS (not belonging to Cloudflare), FRPs were reported to be an implementation of a certain CDN technology, and each FRP does not correspond to the same host, but the details were not provided. Furthermore, in five ASes, FRPs were reported to be implemented based on existing functionality of the Linux system, and each FRP corresponds to the same host. The mentioned implementation methods are as follows: (1) net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind. It is a configuration option in the Linux kernel that controls the binding of IPv6 addresses. When set to 1, it allows binding to non-local IPv6 addresses, i.e. FRPs are implemented. (2) ip -6 route add local PREFIX dev IFACE. This is a command to add an IPv6 local route on a Linux system for a specific IPv6 prefix on a network interface (IFACE). In addition, we investigated that the IP FREEBIND option in Linux also enables multiple IPv6 addresses to be bound to the same host [14]. Moreover, they also share usage scenarios for these FRPs, including: (1) Spreading requests over many IP addresses to address IP-based rate limiting in large systems. (2) FRPs used as proxy services (e.g., intranet proxies) to assign random IPv6 addresses to users.\nKey takeaways: We sent emails to 280 ASes.

Impact of Our FRPlist\nFRPlist is very important for IPv6 network measurement campaigns, which can effectively reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement.

The deployment of IPv6 Fragmentation and Reassembly (FRPs) is most likely to benefit several industries and services, as indicated by the information provided in the data tables. These include:\n\n1. **Cloud and CDN Services**: Cloud or CDN service providers are identified as significant contributors to FRPs ([0]). This suggests that the use of IPv6 FRPs is particularly prevalent in cloud computing and content delivery network environments. The widespread use of FRPs in these areas could be attributed to the need for efficient data handling and distribution, which is a cornerstone of cloud and CDN services.\n\n2. **Online Music and Video Streaming Services**: This category of organizations is mentioned as using FRPs to provide high bandwidth and low latency services ([6]). The requirement for high performance and low latency is crucial for streaming services, making IPv6 FRPs a valuable tool for ensuring smooth and uninterrupted content delivery.\n\n3. **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**: ISPs, as organizations, have a significant number of aliased prefixes as indicated by the FRPlist ([0]). FRPs are likely used by ISPs to manage network traffic, enhance security, and optimize network performance, especially in the context of IPv6 networks.\n\n4. **Network Measurement and Analysis**: The use of FRPs can introduce bias in network measurements ([9]). Therefore, the industry of network measurement and analysis benefits from understanding and mitigating these biases. IPv6 FRPs are a critical factor in this context, as they can impact the accuracy of measurements and analysis.\n\n5. **IPv6 Network Measurement**: IPv6 network measurements specifically are enhanced by tools like Luori, which use FRPs for efficient probing and evaluation ([5]). This indicates that the deployment of IPv6 FRPs is advantageous in assessing the performance and behavior of IPv6 networks.\n\nIn summary, the industries and services most likely to benefit from the deployment of IPv6 FRPs include cloud and CDN services, online music and video streaming services, ISPs, network measurement and analysis, and IPv6 network measurement. These sectors rely on the efficiency, performance, and accuracy provided by IPv6 FRPs to enhance their services and operations.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

The deployment of IPv6 Fully Responsive Routing Prefixes (FRPs) is most likely to benefit several key industries and services, as indicated by the information provided in the data tables and sources. The primary beneficiaries include:\n\n### Cloud and CDN Service Providers\nCloud and CDN service providers such as Cloudflare, Akamai, and Amazon are among the most significant users of FRPs. These organizations require large-scale addressing to efficiently support their services, and FRPs offer a technical means to achieve this. For instance, Cloudflare's addressing agility approach utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, enhancing addressing flexibility ([4], [2]). This allows authoritative name servers to select addresses from full prefixes, ensuring that all addresses within the prefix must respond, which is crucial for services like high-bandwidth and low-latency content delivery ([8], [2]).\n\n### Network Security Organizations\nNetwork security entities, such as Imperva (Incapsula), often use FRPs in their operations. Cloudflare Spectrum, which is a part of Cloudflare's security offerings, employs IPv6 FRPs for DDoS protection, serving as reverse TCP/UDP proxies ([9], [2]). This demonstrates the role of FRPs in enhancing network security and mitigating cyber threats.\n\n### Online Music and Video Streaming Services\nCDN networks, which are integral to online music and video streaming services, utilize FRPs to provide high-bandwidth and low-latency content delivery. This is essential for maintaining a seamless user experience, especially for services that rely on real-time streaming ([9], [2]).\n\n### Internet Service Providers (ISPs)\nISPs may also benefit from the use of FRPs, particularly in assigning random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time. This can enhance privacy and security by preventing IP address tracking and enabling more dynamic network management ([9], [2]).\n\nIn summary, the industries and services most likely to benefit from the deployment of IPv6 FRPs include cloud and CDN service providers, network security organizations, online music and video streaming services, and internet service providers. These entities leverage FRPs to enhance addressing flexibility, improve security, and deliver high-quality services with minimal latency.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze these FRPs we probed and to verify their authenticity, we have sent emails to network managers of 280 different ASes (mailboxes are accessible and contain more FRPs). As of now, we have only received responses from 7 ASes, one of which was not aware of such prefixes. But they both confirm that the FRPs we probed are correct. Specifically, in one AS (not belonging to Cloudflare), FRPs were reported to be an implementation of a certain CDN technology, and each FRP does not correspond to the same host, but the details were not provided. Furthermore, in five ASes, FRPs were reported to be implemented based on existing functionality of the Linux system, and each FRP corresponds to the same host. The mentioned implementation methods are as follows: (1) net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind. It is a configuration option in the Linux kernel that controls the binding of IPv6 addresses. When set to 1, it allows binding to non-local IPv6 addresses, i.e. FRPs are implemented. (2) ip -6 route add local PREFIX dev IFACE. This is a command to add an IPv6 local route on a Linux system for a specific IPv6 prefix on a network interface (IFACE). In addition, we investigated that the IP FREEBIND option in Linux also enables multiple IPv6 addresses to be bound to the same host [14]. Moreover, they also share usage scenarios for these FRPs, including: (1) Spreading requests over many IP addresses to address IP-based rate limiting in large systems. (2) FRPs used as proxy services (e.g., intranet proxies) to assign random IPv6 addresses to users.\nKey takeaways: We sent emails to 280 ASes. Although only 7 replies were received, they verified the authenticity of our probed FRPs and our analysis of FRP usage scenarios (§IV-F),\n   /48\n0.99\n0.39\n  /47\n     0.89\n /80\n 0.075\n/56\n     /48\n0.99\n0.21\n/47\n      /64\n0.99\n/48\n      CDF\nCDF\nCDF\nCDF\n    \nAS #FRPs 19551 165k\nFRPlist Org\nImperva Cloudflare Amazon Akamai Denpa RACKTECH Facebook Black Mesa Claro NXT Akamai\nTCP/Port AS #FRPs\n80/443/... 16509 1260 80/443 36183 1219 80/443 13335 366\n80/443/53 19551 312 22 204916 248 80 36492 237\n- 210842 222 22 54113 171 - 45609 167 - 216157 163\nFRRPlist Org\nAmazon\nAkamai Cloudflare Imperva RACKTECH Google Rohmad Kumiadin Fastly Bharti Airtel SIXNET\nTCP/Port AS\n80/443 19551 - 13335 80/443 16509 80/443/... 20940\n80/53 131662 - 204916\n22 32934 80/443 46997 - 28573 22 36492\n#FRPs\n164k 98.6k 96.7k 36.3k 26.1k 18.1k 9.64k 3.75k 2.35k 1.97k\nFRNRPlist Org\nImperva Cloudflare Amazon Akamai Denpa RACKTECH Facebook Black Mesa Claro NXT Google\nTCP/Port\n80/443/... 80/443 80/443 80/443/53 22 53/80\n- 22 - -\n13335 16509 20940 131662 204916 32934 46997 28573 36183\n99k 97.9k 36.3k 26.1k 18.4k 9.64k 3.75k 2.36k 2.24k\nTABLE III\nTOP 10 ASES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FRPS IN FRPLIST, FRRPLIST, AND FRNRPLIST, RESPECTIVELY.\ne.g., load balancing of IP addresses in large systems, proxy services.

Impact of Our FRPlist\nFRPlist is very important for IPv6 network measurement campaigns, which can effectively reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement. Meanwhile, this can also avoid different researchers and organizations from carrying out similar repet- itive probing\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

IPv6 Fully Responsive Routing Prefixes (FRPs) are most likely to benefit several industries and services, especially those requiring addressing flexibility, efficient network operations, and robust security measures. Based on the provided data, the following sectors are identified as key beneficiaries:\n\n1. **Cloud and CDN Service Providers**: Organizations like Cloudflare, Akamai, and Amazon are likely to benefit significantly from IPv6 FRPs. As indicated in the "Entities" table ([4], [5], [6]), these companies provide cloud and content delivery network (CDN) services. The use of FRPs allows them to efficiently support their services by providing a large number of network addresses, which can be crucial for load balancing, addressing agility, and improved performance.\n\n2. **Network Security**: Cloudflare Spectrum, which is mentioned in relation to Imperva (Incapsula) ([13], [32]-[34]), may be one example of how FRPs are used in network security. FRPs can be used for DDoS protection, reverse TCP/UDP proxies, and other security measures, enhancing the robustness of network defenses.\n\n3. **Online Music and Video Streaming Services**: These services require high bandwidth and low latency, which can be facilitated by the use of FRPs. The efficient distribution of traffic across multiple IP addresses can help in managing the load and ensuring a smooth user experience.\n\n4. **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**: ISPs can leverage FRPs for proxy services, assigning random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time. This can enhance user privacy and security, as well as optimize network performance.\n\n5. **Network Measurement Campaigns**: IPv6 measurement campaigns benefit from the availability of FRP lists, such as the FRPlist, which provides insights into the practical application and analysis of FRPs ([8]).\n\nThe "Sources" table further supports these observations, noting that FRPs are widely used in practice, particularly in cloud and CDN networks, and that large ASes with many FRPs are often from Cloud or CDN service providers ([9]). Additionally, the analysis of the FRPlist indicates that a significant number of FRPs come from these providers, suggesting a strong reliance on FRPs for addressing flexibility and efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the industries and services most likely to benefit from the deployment of IPv6 FRPs include cloud and CDN service providers, network security firms, online music and video streaming services, ISPs, and organizations involved in network measurement campaigns.

The presence of Forwarding Reputation Prefixes (FRPs) in datasets such as Hitlist's active address dataset can introduce several forms of bias or errors in network measurements. These issues arise due to the nature of FRPs and the methods used to collect and analyze network data.\n\nFirstly, FRPs can lead to **inaccurate representation of active addresses**. As indicated in the Sources table ([8]), Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses detected by MAPD. However, MAPD only detects prefixes smaller than /64 and containing more than 100 active addresses under them. This selective detection can result in a bias towards larger, more active networks, which may not accurately reflect the overall state of the network. For instance, smaller networks with fewer active addresses might be overlooked, leading to an overestimation of the size and activity of larger networks.\n\nSecondly, FRPs can cause **measurement conclusions distortion** ([19]). Since FRPs are often used to provide flexible and scalable network services, their presence can skew the results of network measurements. For example, if a network measurement is designed to assess the responsiveness of a particular set of addresses, the presence of FRPs that are not actual hosts (Fully Responsive Routing Prefixes) could misrepresent the real responsiveness of the network. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about network performance, security, or traffic patterns.\n\nFurthermore, FRPs can introduce **resource wastage in probing processes** ([9]). Probing methods that rely on active address datasets might inadvertently probe addresses behind FRPs, which are not actual hosts but routing prefixes. This can result in wasted resources, as these probes do not provide meaningful information about the actual network devices. Over time, this repetitive probing can lead to inefficiencies in network measurement efforts.\n\nLastly, the **heterogeneity of FRP usage** can also contribute to measurement biases. The Sources table ([8]) mentions that FRPs are widely used across various industries, including Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, and ISPs. The diverse uses of FRPs can lead to different patterns of network behavior, which may not be captured uniformly in datasets like Hitlist's. This can result in inconsistent and potentially misleading measurement outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of FRPs in datasets like Hitlist's active address dataset can introduce significant biases and errors in network measurements. These issues stem from the selective detection of active addresses, the misrepresentation of network responsiveness, resource wastage in probing processes, and the diverse and varied uses of FRPs across different industries.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

The presence of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) in datasets like Hitlist's active address dataset can introduce bias or errors in network measurements due to several factors:\n\n1. **Selection Bias**: FRPs are typically associated with specific network configurations that respond to address probing. When these prefixes are included in active address datasets like Hitlist's, they may skew the results because they do not represent the general behavior of all IPv6 prefixes. This is particularly relevant when measuring the readiness or performance of IPv6 networks, as FRPs may not accurately reflect the typical network behavior.\n\n2. **Overrepresentation of Large Organizations**: As mentioned in the Sources data ([8]), FRPs are often associated with large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Cloudflare, Amazon, and Akamai. These organizations may have a higher presence in datasets like Hitlist due to their extensive network infrastructure. This overrepresentation can lead to a bias in the measurement results, as the dataset may not be representative of smaller or less visible networks.\n\n3. **Prefix Length Distribution**: The FRPlist contains a diverse distribution of prefix lengths, with many FRPs having lengths less than or equal to 48 ([8]). This is different from the distribution of IPv6 prefixes in general, which may have a wider range of lengths. When such a distribution is used in network measurements, it can introduce errors, as the dataset may not reflect the overall prefix length distribution of the IPv6 Internet.\n\n4. **Limited Scope of Probing Methods**: The FRPs in datasets like Hitlist are often collected using methods such as MAPD, which focuses on detecting prefixes smaller than /64 with more than 100 active addresses ([2]). This method may miss larger FRPs or those with lower levels of activity, leading to incomplete or inaccurate measurement results.\n\n5. **Impact on IPv6 Measurement Campaigns**: FRPs can significantly impact IPv6 measurement campaigns ([7]), as they influence the results of various network measurements, including active address probing and security analysis ([3]). When FRPs are present in datasets like Hitlist, they can distort the measurement outcomes, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the performance and behavior of IPv6 networks.\n\nIn summary, the presence of FRPs in datasets like Hitlist's active address dataset can introduce bias and errors in network measurements due to selection bias, overrepresentation of large organizations, prefix length distribution, limited scope of probing methods, and their impact on IPv6 measurement campaigns. This highlights the importance of considering the context and limitations of such datasets when interpreting network measurement results.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

However, a special type of IPv6 prefix called Fully Responsive Prefix (FRP) is having a significant impact on IPv6 measurement campaigns, which is defined as all addresses under a prefix responding to scans. Obviously, there cannot be a real responder behind each of these addresses. To reveal the current status and impact of Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, we propose for the first time an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, Luori, which cleverly transforms the active probing process under IPv6 huge prefix space (potential range of prefix presence) into a dynamic search process in a tree based on reinforcement learning, achieving efficient probing of arbitrary routing prefixes. The evaluation results show that Luori found 31.7K largest FRPs in a single Internet-wide probing with 11M budget, covering 1.5×1030 address space, which is 106× that of existing methods. More importantly, after six months of Internet-wide probing, we have found 516k largest FRPs, which covers 1.3 × 1033 address space and 795 ASes, making it the largest publicly known FRP list. Based on this list, we screen out 20% of the addresses covered by FRPs from a well-known IPv6 active address dataset. Furthermore, we further analyze and find that the distribution of these FRPs is extensive and their implementation methods are diverse, which can provide beneficial references for the practical application of FRPs. Finally, we make this list publicly available and maintain it long-term for use and study by relevant researchers.\nIndex Terms—IPv6, fully responsive prefix, active probing I. INTRODUCTION\nAs the new generation of Internet protocol, IPv6 is undergo- ing rapid development and widespread deployment worldwide. As of May 2024, about 40% of Google users have access to services over IPv6, up from less than 2% a decade ago [1]. It is foreseeable that IPv6 will gradually replace IPv4 as the core of the Internet over time. Therefore, IPv6 network measurement, which is an important foundation for network situational awareness and network security, will become more and more important. For example, a large number of IPv6 active addresses (addresses that respond to scans) probing research [2]–[11] has been proposed in recent years, which is the basis for IPv6 network measurement.\nHowever, a special class of prefixes under IPv6 is making a huge impact on IPv6 network measurement, namely the fully responsive prefix (FRP) [12], [13], which is defined as all addresses under a prefix respond to probes (such as ICMPv6). For example, a single /48 FRP can cover 280 responsive addresses, but it is impossible for each of these addresses to correspond to a unique responder. Therefore, if FRPs are ignored in network measurement campaigns, a large number of probing resources may fall into the “FRP\ntraps”, which not only wastes a lot of probing resources and time, but also results in few real probing targets and even distorts measurement conclusions. For example, in IPv6 active address probing, if an FRP is not discovered in time, all the probing resources will likely be gradually invested under the FRP until it is consumed. However, the rewards is meager. In a dataset containing 24.5M active IPv6 addresses from a well-known Hitlist service [12], [14], [15] (§IV-H), we found that there are 4.8M addresses under FRPs, accounting for a proportion of 20%. According to the 20%-50% hit rate of most of the current active address probing methods [2]– [6], [8]–[11], there are nearly 9.6M-24M probes that do not probe the real active addresses, i.e., the probing resources are wasted. Even worse, when we conduct other network measurement campaigns based on these addresses (e.g., port scanning [16], [17] and topology discovery [18]–[20]), the measurement results are unable to accurately reflect the real situation in the network, and may even be erroneous.\nCurrently, research on FRPs is scarce. Efforts such as [6], [8], [14] have identified the presence of FRPs in active address probing and have proposed methods akin to brute- force probing to validate FRPs in probed active addresses (§II). Sattler et al. [13] have also studied similar prefixes (highly responsive prefixes) under IPv4 through brute-force probing. However, under IPv6, brute-force probing of Internet-wide FRPs is impractical, even with some high-speed tools like ZMap [21] and Masscan [22]. This is because IPv6’s address space is 296 times that of IPv4. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an efficient active probing method for Internet-wide FRPs and to perform long-term probing, thereby constructing and maintaining an Internet-wide FRP list (FRPlist) over time. On the one hand, this FRPlist can be used directly by relevant researchers to mitigate the impact of FRPs on their measurement campaigns. It can also serve as a dataset for the research community to avoid unnecessary network burden caused by redundant measurements. On the other hand, this FRPlist can reveal the current status and characteristics of Internet-wide FRPs that have emerged in abundance. This information can be used to explore the usage scenarios and implementation methods of FRPs, offering insights into their practical application in the network. However, achieving this goal is not straightforward, and we confront the following challenges:\n• Sparse distribution. Despite the considerable number of FRPs, their distribution is\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

The presence of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) in datasets such as Hitlist's active address dataset can introduce significant bias and errors in network measurements. FRPs are IPv6 prefixes where all addresses respond to scans, such as ICMPv6, which can lead to several issues:\n\n1. **Overestimation of Active Addresses**: As mentioned in the Sources section ([1]), a single /48 FRP can cover 280 responsive addresses. If an FRP is not identified, all these addresses may be considered active, leading to an overestimation of the number of active addresses in the network. This overestimation can range from 20% to 50% ([16]), as indicated by the current active address probing methods ([16]).\n\n2. **Wasted Probing Resources**: When FRPs are not detected, probing resources, such as time and bandwidth, are wasted on scanning these addresses. The Sources section ([1]) highlights that in a dataset containing 24.5M active IPv6 addresses, 4.8M addresses fall under FRPs, accounting for a significant portion. If probing resources are not allocated efficiently, it can lead to a lack of real probing targets and distort the measurement conclusions ([16]).\n\n3. **Distorted Measurement Results**: Network measurements that rely on active address probing, such as port scanning or topology discovery, may produce inaccurate results if FRPs are not considered. The Sources section ([1]) notes that when conducting measurements based on addresses under FRPs, the results may not accurately reflect the real network situation and may even be erroneous ([16]).\n\nTo mitigate these issues, researchers and network measurement campaigns need to consider the presence of FRPs. The development of methods like Luori ([2]), an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, can help in identifying and excluding FRPs from the measurement datasets. By doing so, the accuracy and reliability of network measurements can be significantly improved.

reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement. Meanwhile, this can also avoid different researchers and organizations from carrying out similar repet- itive probing processes, thereby adding unnecessary burden to the network. Although the Hitlist has published the existing FRPlist collects in previous active address probing, which is not comprehensive and does not fully satisfy the requirements.\nTo prove this point, we chose the latest (May 4, 2024) publicly active address dataset from the Hitlist for experiments. The dataset contains 24.5M active addresses, which have been filtered using the Hitlist’s own FRPlist. However, after comparing it to our FRPlist, we found that there are still 4.8M addresses under FRPs, accounting for a proportion of 20%. This means that about 20% of the probing resources were wasted. More importantly, the IPv6 active address dataset in Hitlist is a commonly used dataset under IPv6, which is likely to be used as a dataset for further measurement research, such as continuing active address probing as seeds [2]–[5], [8]–[11], port probing [16], [17], Security analysis [17], [35]. However, when we are unaware of the presence of addresses under FRPs, this may lead to some unknown measurement bias or even wrong conclusions. As an intuitive example, when further asset probing is performed based on these addresses, we may find a much higher amount of assets than in the real network.\nKey takeaways: IPv6 FRPs have resulted in a massive amount of fake active addresses in the network, e.g., the well- known and commonly used Hitlist’s active address dataset\ncontains 20% of such addresses, significantly impacting all measurement activities based on this dataset. Therefore, it is essential to actively probe Internet-wide FRPs to reveal this impact and to construct a long-maintained FRPlist for use by relevant researchers.\n10\n4.5K 3K 1.5K 0\n360K 240K 120K\n0\nChina\nChina\nSingapore\nBritain\nICMPv6\nJapan\n(a) Internet-wide FRRPs\nJapan\n(b) NFRRPs in the NFRRPlist\nTCP/80\nTCP/443\nAmerica\nAmerica\nSingapore\nBritain\nFig. 7.

Spatial Stability.\nTo study the impact of vantage points on FRPlist, we performed scans based on ICMPv6, TCP/80 and TCP/443 at geographically and topologically diverse vantage points. Fig. 7 shows the results of our scanning and determination of Internet-wide FRRPs and FRNRPs in the FRNRPlist in May 2024, where the vantage points are distributed across five different countries and the results are averaged over multiple experiments to minimize the impact of network fluctuations. For the Internet-wide FRRPs, it can be seen that the results are basically similar at different vantage points. Although relatively fewer FRRPs were obtained at the Japanese vantage point, we found some cases of incomplete response of 16 random addresses as mentioned earlier, which may also be due to the network environment. For the FRNRPs in FRNRPlist, we found an interesting phenomenon that the number of FRNRPs obtained at the three vantage points in Asia was consistent. However, the number of FRNRPs determined to be FRNRPs at the vantage points in Britain and America\n      #NFRRPs\n#FRRPs\n\nwas about one-third less. Meanwhile, this phenomenon was indeed absent for FRRPs scanned at the same time. We analyze FRRPs as global routing prefixes, so their routes are richer and more reliable. However, FRNRPs may be correlated with vantage points. Because the FRPlist in this paper was obtained by probing in Asia, some of these FRNRPs may show unreachability in some other vantage point scans.\nTo confirm the above analysis, we compared the list of FRNRPs at different vantage points and found that the FRN- RPs that are less found in Britain and America vantage points are indeed a subset of the Asian vantage points. Further, we comparatively obtained FRNRPs that could not be determined at Britain and America vantage points and scanned them again. We find that a large number of them suffer from request unreachability, i.e., they cannot fully receive responses from all 16 random addresses. This may be the root cause of them not being determined as FRPs at Britain and America vantage points, as we perform the scanning by sending only one request per address to occupy as little network resources as possible. Since the FRPlist in this paper was obtained by probing in Asia, the three vantage points in Asia were less affected. However, this shows that the active probing of FRPs are related to the vantage points, but the impact can be reduced by sending multiple requests to the same address during the probing.\nKey take-take-away:\nJ. Aliased Prefixes in FRPs\nAs mentioned earlier, a huge address space is covered under FRPs, where each address obviously cannot be mapped to a real host separately. Therefore, to analyze the configuration between FRPs and hosts in FRPlist, we performed aliased prefix detection on FRPs in FRPlist based on the FAPD algorithm, i.e., to determine whether an FRP maps to a host.

The APD (Active Prefix Detection) method, as described in the provided data, is an approach used to detect whether a prefix is a real FRP (Fast-Routing Proxy) or not. While the data does not explicitly list the limitations of the APD method, we can infer several potential limitations based on general knowledge about similar detection methods and the information given:\n\n1. **Limited Scope of Detection**: The APD method may have limitations in detecting FRPs that are not actively routing traffic. If an FRP is not actively routing traffic, it might not be detected by the method, which relies on active probing and analysis of routing prefixes.\n\n2. **False Positives and Negatives**: Any detection method, including APD, can produce false positives (incorrectly identifying a prefix as an FRP) or false negatives (failing to identify an FRP). This could be due to the complexity of network routing and the presence of similar routing patterns that might be misinterpreted by the detection algorithm.\n\n3. **Resource Intensive**: The APD method involves active probing, which can be resource-intensive. This could lead to high network traffic and processing demands, especially when scanning a large number of prefixes. This might not be feasible in all network environments, particularly those with limited resources or high latency.\n\n4. **Geographical Limitations**: The effectiveness of the APD method might be affected by the geographical distribution of the vantage points used for scanning. The data mentions that the APD detection method was tested at various vantage points around the world, but it does not specify whether all potential FRP locations have been covered. This could lead to incomplete detection if certain regions are not adequately represented.\n\n5. **Outdated Information**: The APD method may struggle to keep up with the rapid changes in the network landscape. New FRPs can emerge, and existing ones can change their behavior or routing patterns, which might not be immediately detected by the APD method.\n\n6. **Complexity of Routing Protocols**: The data suggests that the APD method is used in conjunction with various protocols (e.g., ICMPv6, TCP/80, TCP/443) for scanning. The complexity of these protocols and the potential for misconfiguration or unexpected behavior could complicate the detection process and introduce additional limitations.\n\nIn summary, while the APD method is a valuable tool for detecting FRPs, it may be subject to limitations such as scope of detection, accuracy, resource intensity, geographical coverage, the need for up-to-date information, and the complexity of routing protocols.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

The APD method, as referenced in the "Entities" table with id 19 ([19]), appears to be an organization or system that performs initial FRP detection. However, the provided data does not offer specific details regarding the limitations of the APD method for detecting Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs). To understand potential limitations, we can infer from the broader context of FRP detection methods and the data presented.\n\n1. **Limited Coverage**: The "Sources" table indicates that the distribution of FRPs among Autonomous Systems (ASes) is concentrated in a few, particularly large Cloud or CDN service providers ([8]). If APD is primarily focused on detecting FRPs within these large organizations, it may have limitations in detecting FRPs from smaller or less obvious sources.\n\n2. **Assumption-Based Detection**: The method might rely on certain assumptions about the behavior of FRPs, such as their association with specific types of networks or services. This could lead to false positives or negatives if the assumptions do not hold true for all FRPs.\n\n3. **Performance Limitations**: The "Relationships" table shows that Luori, another FRP detection method ([1]), outperforms MAPD in terms of the number of SFRP and NAS, indicating superior performance in probing FRPs ([5]). If APD does not match the performance of Luori or other advanced methods, it may struggle to detect all FRPs effectively.\n\n4. **Scalability Issues**: As the "Sources" table suggests, the FRPlist covers a significant amount of address space, and the length distribution of FRPs is diverse ([8]). A method like APD may face scalability challenges in processing and analyzing such a large and varied dataset.\n\n5. **Lack of Contextual Information**: The data does not provide information on how APD determines whether a prefix is a FRP. Without contextual information on the detection criteria, it is difficult to assess potential limitations related to accuracy or robustness.\n\nIn summary, while the provided data does not directly address the limitations of the APD method, potential issues may include limited coverage, assumption-based detection, performance relative to other methods, scalability challenges, and a lack of contextual information on the detection process.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze\n2,\tthe prefix represented by this node is already an FRP. Therefore, this node should not be selected, and this branch will not be probed, as its child nodes must also be FRP. At this point, based on the above function, it can be determined that Q = 0, indicates that the node will not be selected during the probing process.\nii) When Vf = 0 and 2, it means that the node is NFRP and unknown, and both of them will be possible to be selected. In this case, |Vf −1| = 1, which does not affect the calculation of Q. Note that a node with Vf = 0 simply means that the node itself is an NFRP, but it does not mean that all its children are also NFRP. Therefore, it may still be selected, i.e., continue\nFig. 3. FRP Probing (search tree in initial state is shown in Fig. 2)\n  5\n\nexploring this branch downwards. However, it is necessary to ensure that it is not the last node to be recursively selected.\nMoreover, in our scenario, a larger prefix of an FRP may also be an FRP (i.e., the parent node of FRP). If we keep selecting leaf nodes for probing, it may lead to a lot of wasted probing resources. Therefore, in state s, the last recursively selected node is all nodes with Vf = 2 in the tree, not just the leaf nodes with Vf = 2. At the same time, this also exactly avoids selecting the prefix represented by nodes with Vf = 0. To realize the selection of non-leaf nodes, we design a simple but effective method. When there are more than n FRP among the child nodes of a parent node and no NFRP, we prioritize selecting the parent node to determine if it is an FRP, to avoid wasting probing resources. As shown in Fig. 3, it illustrates a possible selection path (the search tree is from Fig. 2). Typically, there is a bias toward exploitation, i.e., ε is set smaller, as selecting based on Qk often leads to higher real rewards. Therefore, the node with the maximum Qk among the known nodes in each layer will be selected with a higher probability, i.e., node “1”, “f” is selected. Meanwhile, since node “9” represents the seed prefix (i.e., Qk = 0) and cannot be selected, the potential node “8” with the maximum Qp is selected. Note that when there is more than one node corresponding to the maximum Q, it is sufficient to select randomly from them. Finally, when the target prefix is 2003:89af:0011:/48, a candidate FRP prefix 2003:89af:0011:1f80::/60 consisting of selected nodes is generated (i.e., prefix represented by node “8”).\n2) Probing: The aim is to expand the children of the selected node and detect whether the node is FRP or not. For the selected node, we first expand its child nodes, i.e., a total of 16 child nodes from 0 to f are created. Meanwhile, we also continue to randomly expand the 16 addresses based on the selected nodes and the expanded child nodes. Next, these 16 addresses are scanned online by sending ICMPv6 requests to determine whether they are responsive, as the states of the selected nodes and possible states of the child nodes are reflected by these 16 addresses, according to the APD detection method. As shown in Fig. 3, based on the selected “1f8”, the 16 addresses obtained by the expansion are 2003 : 89af : 0011 : 1f8{0−f} : ∗∗∗∗ : ∗∗∗∗ : ∗∗∗∗ : ∗∗∗∗. And it may be that just address 2003 : 89af : 0011 : 1f8{0−1}:∗∗∗∗:∗∗∗∗:∗∗∗∗:∗∗∗∗ is responsive.\n3) Backpropagation: The purpose of this step is to update the value information of nodes (i.e., state of the tree) based on the response status of the 16 addresses in the probing, starting from the expanded 16 child nodes in reverse, layer by layer, until reaching the root node. It is important to note here that once a potential node has been selected and the probing has been executed, it will be transformed into a known node. Before performing the backpropagation, its value information will be transformed from Vp and Np to Vk and Nk and initialized to 0. Based to the APD method, there will be three scenarios as follows:\n• Case 1: when all 16 addresses have responses, the selected\nnode is an FRP. At this time, consistent with the backprop-\nagation in search tree construction (§III-B), the Vk and Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by v and 1, respectively. And the corresponding Vp (i.e., v − −) is propagated to the potential nodes. Furthermore, the Vf of the selected node is set to 1, and the expanded child nodes will be pruned.\n• Case 2: when 16 addresses are partially responsive (e.g, only m address responses), the Vk and Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by m and 1, respectively. The Vp and Np of the responsive child nodes is added 1, and V\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

The APD (Active Prefix Detection) method, which is used for detecting FRPs (Fully Responsive Prefixes), has several potential limitations that can impact its effectiveness and accuracy:\n\n1. **Limited Scope of Detection**: APD primarily focuses on detecting prefixes smaller than /64 and containing more than 100 active addresses under them. This means it may miss FRPs that are larger or have fewer active addresses. ([3])\n\n2. **False Positives**: The method might produce false positives, where a prefix is incorrectly identified as an FRP. This could be due to the presence of legitimate traffic or misconfigurations in the network. ([3])\n\n3. **Limited to Active Address Probing**: APD relies on active address probing, which can be intrusive and may impact the performance of the network under observation. This could be particularly problematic in sensitive or production environments. ([3])\n\n4. **Limited to IPv6 Prefixes**: The method is specifically designed for IPv6 prefixes, which may not be suitable for detecting FRPs in IPv4 networks. ([3])\n\n5. **Data Collection Challenges**: Collecting data for APD requires access to a large number of prefixes, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This could limit the scope and accuracy of the detection process. ([3])\n\n6. **Inability to Detect Unknown FRPs**: APD is not effective in detecting FRPs that are not known or documented, as it relies on predefined criteria for detection. This means it may miss new or emerging FRPs that are not yet identified. ([3])\n\n7. **Performance Metrics Limitations**: The method's performance can be influenced by various factors, such as the number of active addresses, the size of the prefix, and the overall network traffic. These factors can make it difficult to establish a consistent and reliable performance metric for APD. ([3])\n\nIn summary, while the APD method is a valuable tool for detecting FRPs, its limitations in scope, accuracy, and practicality should be considered when implementing and evaluating its effectiveness in a network environment.

On the other hand, this FRPlist can reveal the current status and characteristics of Internet-wide FRPs that have emerged in abundance. This information can be used to explore the usage scenarios and implementation methods of FRPs, offering insights into their practical application in the network. However, achieving this goal is not straightforward, and we confront the following challenges:\n• Sparse distribution. Despite the considerable number of FRPs, their distribution is still extremely sparse when com- pared to the vast IPv6 address space, presenting a significant\n1\n\nchallenge for their detection and discovery.\n• Diverse FRP patterns. The implementation of FRPs can\nvary widely and may be of arbitrary lengths, e.g., the FRP patterns under different global routing prefixes may be different, which makes it difficult to analyze and extract their features.\n• Dynamic change. FRP patterns may change dynamically over time, e.g., when the network environment changes. Continuously capturing FRP patterns to achieve long-term effective probing is necessary but challenging.\nTo tackle the above challenges, we propose Luori, an efficient FRP active probing method based on reinforcement learning, which can probe FRPs under any target prefix at Internet scale. The core idea is to represent the entire probing space as a tree, and then abstract the probing process as a dynamic search process in the tree. Specifically, we utilize the hierarchical nature of trees to represent the entire poten- tial probing space, which is applicable to any FRP pattern, and to initially carve potential FRP patterns for each target prefix in the tree based on known FRPs. Then, based on the reinforcement learning idea, we propose an ingenious ε- Q strategy, which can continuously captures FRP patterns and adjust the direction of probing in the tree based on the probing feedback, thereby improving the probing efficiency and long- term probing effectiveness under the huge prefix space. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study about Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, which main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n• We propose an Internet-wide FRP active probing method based on reinforcement learning, i.e., Luori, which is also the first known Internet-wide FRP active probing method.\n• We have implemented and deployed Luori to allow contin- uous probing of Internet-wide FRPs. The evaluation results show that Luori found 31.7K FRPs1 in a single Internet- wide probing with 11M budget2, covering 1.5×1030 address space3 , which is 106 × that of brute-force probing.\n• As of now, Luori has been continuously probing Internet- wide for almost six months and has found 516k FRPs, which covers 1.3×1033 address space and 795 ASes, far exceeding the existing FRPlist, making it the largest publicly known FRPlist. Additionally, we also verified the authenticity of probed FRPs by sending about 280 emails. we also make the code and the FRPlist of this paper publicly available4 and maintain it long-term for use and study by the research community.\n• For the well-known and commonly used active address dataset (e.g., Gasser’s hitlist [12], [14], [15], we find that 20% of its addresses belong to the FRPs we provide. Fur- thermore, our analysis reveals that the FRPs in the FRPlist mainly come from about 650 organizations in industries\n1number of FRPs after taking the largest (same as below), i.e., avoid co- existence of a prefix and its sub-prefixes\n2number of FRPs planned for probing 3number of addresses covered by the FRPs 4https://frpv6.github.io/\nsuch as Cloud or CDN services, and network security. Mean- while, the implementation of FRPs is diverse, in addition to the specific technical means of Cloud or CDN vendors (e.g., Cloudflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23]), most of them are based on the existing functionality implemented in Linux systems (e.g., net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind option).\nII. RELATED WORK\nIPv6 FRPs. 6Gen [6] first mentioned such prefixes in IPv6 active address probing, naming such prefixes aliased prefixes and defining them as prefixes where all addresses within respond to scans and are considered responses from a single host. Subsequently, Zirngibl et al. [12] discovered that the technical implementations of some CDN vendors also result in all addresses of a prefix responding to scans, but these responses are not from a single host, such as Cloudflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23]. Therefore, Zirngibl et al. introduced the concept of FRPs and defined that all addresses under it respond to scans, which is the superset of aliased prefixes. In addition, DET [8] defines such prefixes as active prefixes, equivalent to FRPs. In this paper, we follow the concept of FRPs.\nFRP Probing. In IPv6 active address probing, 6Gen [6] and Gasser et al. [14] have respectively proposed FRP probing methods based on active addresses to avoid their impact on active address probing results, especially the MAPD method proposed by Gasser et al. has become a common method. Note that MAPD claims to be an aliased prefix probing method, but it does not determine that responses under a prefix all come from the same host, so it is still essentially an FRP probing method. In subsequent active address probing research based on MAPD [2], [3], [5], [8], [10], IPv6 FRPs were found to be commonly present in networks. The core of MAPD is to brute- force enumerate prefixes of all lengths contained in the active address as candidate FRPs5, and then detect"\r\n\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

Luori, an efficient FRP active probing method based on reinforcement learning, adapts to the sparse and dynamically changing distribution of FRPs through several innovative approaches:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Probing Space Representation**: Luori represents the entire potential probing space as a tree structure. This hierarchical nature allows the method to accommodate the vast IPv6 address space and the sparse distribution of FRPs. By using this tree representation, Luori can efficiently navigate and explore the probing space, making it suitable for detecting FRPs even in scenarios where their distribution is sparse ([Sources], section 1).\n\n2. **Dynamic Search Process**: The probing process in Luori is abstracted as a dynamic search within the tree structure. This dynamic approach enables the method to adapt to changes in the network environment over time. As FRP patterns may change dynamically, Luori can continuously capture these patterns and adjust the probing direction based on the feedback received during the probing process ([Sources], section 1).\n\n3. **\u03b5- Q Strategy**: Luori employs an \u03b5- Q strategy as part of the reinforcement learning idea. This strategy helps in capturing FRP patterns and adjusting the probing direction dynamically. By continuously learning from the probing feedback, Luori can improve its efficiency and long-term probing effectiveness, making it well-suited for environments with dynamic changes in FRP patterns ([Sources], section 1).\n\n4. **Seed Patterns for Initial Probing**: Luori uses known FRPs as seed patterns to initiate the probing process. This approach helps in identifying potential FRP patterns for each target prefix in the tree, which is particularly useful when dealing with a sparse distribution of FRPs ([Sources], section 1).\n\nIn summary, Luori's ability to adapt to the sparse and dynamically changing distribution of FRPs is achieved through its hierarchical probing space representation, dynamic search process, \u03b5- Q strategy, and the use of seed patterns. These features make Luori a robust and efficient method for FRP detection in complex network environments.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

Luori adapts to the sparse and dynamically changing distribution of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) through several strategies, as outlined in the provided data and sources. \n\nFirstly, Luori is an active probing method designed specifically for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs. It utilizes reinforcement learning to efficiently probe arbitrary routing prefixes, which allows it to adapt to the sparse nature of FRPs. The method is capable of probing FRPs of arbitrary length, which is a significant advantage over other probing methods like MAPD. This capability is highlighted in the description of Luori as an organization or method that "probes FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and finds the largest FRPs preferentially" ([1]).\n\nThe dynamic nature of FRPs is addressed by Luori's continuous and efficient discovery of IPv6 FRPs at the Internet scale. This is evident in the description of Luori as an organization or method that "aims to perform continuous and efficient discovery of IPv6 FRPs at the Internet scale" ([1]). The continuous nature of Luori's probing efforts ensures that it can keep up with the changing distribution of FRPs.\n\nMoreover, the effectiveness of Luori in adapting to the sparse and dynamic distribution of FRPs is further supported by the comparative analysis with other probing methods. Luori is shown to outperform MAPD in terms of the number of SFRP (Single Fully Responsive Prefix) and NAS (Number of Active Subnets), indicating its superior performance in probing FRPs ([5]). This outperformance is likely due to Luori's ability to probe a wider range of prefixes and adapt to the sparse distribution of FRPs.\n\nAdditionally, the sources indicate that Luori benefits from the results of its long-term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. This continuous probing helps Luori to maintain an up-to-date and comprehensive list of FRPs, which is crucial for adapting to the dynamic changes in their distribution ([8]).\n\nIn summary, Luori adapts to the sparse and dynamically changing distribution of FRPs through its reinforcement learning-based probing capabilities, continuous and efficient discovery efforts, and the ability to outperform other probing methods in terms of coverage and adaptability.

The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze\n2,\tdataset for the research community to avoid unnecessary network burden caused by redundant measurements. On the other hand, this FRPlist can reveal the current status and characteristics of Internet-wide FRPs that have emerged in abundance. This information can be used to explore the usage scenarios and implementation methods of FRPs, offering insights into their practical application in the network. However, achieving this goal is not straightforward, and we confront the following challenges:\n• Sparse distribution. Despite the considerable number of FRPs, their distribution is still extremely sparse when com- pared to the vast IPv6 address space, presenting a significant\n1\n\nchallenge for their detection and discovery.\n• Diverse FRP patterns. The implementation of FRPs can\nvary widely and may be of arbitrary lengths, e.g., the FRP patterns under different global routing prefixes may be different, which makes it difficult to analyze and extract their features.\n• Dynamic change. FRP patterns may change dynamically over time, e.g., when the network environment changes. Continuously capturing FRP patterns to achieve long-term effective probing is necessary but challenging.\nTo tackle the above challenges, we propose Luori, an efficient FRP active probing method based on reinforcement learning, which can probe FRPs under any target prefix at Internet scale. The core idea is to represent the entire probing space as a tree, and then abstract the probing process as a dynamic search process in the tree. Specifically, we utilize the hierarchical nature of trees to represent the entire poten- tial probing space, which is applicable to any FRP pattern, and to initially carve potential FRP patterns for each target prefix in the tree based on known FRPs. Then, based on the reinforcement learning idea, we propose an ingenious ε- Q strategy, which can continuously captures FRP patterns and adjust the direction of probing in the tree based on the probing feedback, thereby improving the probing efficiency and long- term probing effectiveness under the huge prefix space. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study about Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, which main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n• We propose an Internet-wide FRP active probing method based on reinforcement learning, i.e., Luori, which is also the first known Internet-wide FRP active probing method.\n• We have implemented and deployed Luori to allow contin- uous probing of Internet-wide FRPs. The evaluation results show that Luori found 31.7K FRPs1 in a single Internet- wide probing with 11M budget2, covering 1.5×1030 address space3 , which is 106 × that of brute-force probing.\n• As of now, Luori has been continuously probing Internet- wide for almost six months and has found 516k FRPs, which covers 1.3×1033 address space and 795 ASes, far exceeding the existing FRPlist, making it the largest publicly known FRPlist. Additionally, we also verified the authenticity of probed FRPs by sending about 280 emails. we also make the code and the FRPlist of this paper publicly available4 and maintain it long-term for use and study by the research community.\n• For the well-known and commonly used active address dataset (e.g., Gasser’s hitlist [12], [14], [15], we find that 20% of its addresses belong to the FRPs we provide. Fur- thermore, our analysis reveals that the FRPs in the FRPlist mainly come from about 650 organizations in industries\n1number of FRPs after taking the largest (same as below), i.e., avoid co- existence of a prefix and its sub-prefixes\n2number of FRPs planned for probing 3number of addresses covered by the FRPs 4https://frpv6.github.io/\nsuch as Cloud or CDN services, and network security. Mean- while, the implementation of FRPs is diverse, in addition to the specific technical means of Cloud or CDN vendors (e.g., Cloudflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23]), most of them are based on the existing functionality implemented in Linux systems (e.g., net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind option).\nII. RELATED WORK\nIPv6 FRPs. 6Gen [6] first mentioned such prefixes in IPv6 active address probing, naming such prefixes aliased prefixes and defining them as prefixes where all addresses within respond to scans and are considered responses from a single host. Subsequently, Zirngibl et al. [12] discovered that the technical implementations of some CDN vendors also result in all addresses of a prefix responding to scans, but these responses are not from a single host, such as Cloudflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23]. Therefore, Zirngibl et al. introduced the concept of FRPs and defined that all addresses under it respond to scans, which is the superset of aliased prefixes. In addition, DET [8] defines such prefixes as active prefixes, equivalent to FRPs. In this paper, we follow the concept of FRPs.\nFRP Probing. In IPv6 active address probing, 6Gen [6] and Gasser et al. [14] have respectively proposed FRP probing methods based on active addresses to avoid their impact on active address probing results, especially the MAPD method proposed by Gasser et al. has become a common method. Note that MAPD claims to be an aliased prefix probing method, but it does not determine that responses under a prefix all come from the same host, so it is still essentially an FRP probing method. In subsequent active address probing research based on MAPD [2], [3], [5], [8], [10], IPv6 FRPs were found to be commonly present in networks. The core of MAPD is to brute- force enumerate prefixes of all lengths contained in the active address as candidate FRPs5, and then detect\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

Luori adapts to the sparse and dynamically changing distribution of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) through a combination of innovative techniques and strategies. The system leverages a reinforcement learning approach to efficiently navigate and probe the vast IPv6 address space, addressing the challenges posed by the sparse and dynamic nature of FRPs.\n\n### Sparse Distribution\n\nThe sparse distribution of FRPs, which are scattered across the extensive IPv6 address space, poses a significant challenge for their detection and discovery. To overcome this, Luori employs the following strategies:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Probing Space Representation**: Luori represents the entire probing space as a tree structure. This hierarchical nature allows the system to efficiently traverse the vast address space and focus on potential FRP locations, rather than performing a brute-force search across the entire space.\n\n2. **Potential FRP Patterns**: Based on known FRPs, Luori carves out potential FRP patterns for each target prefix in the tree. This approach helps the system prioritize probing in regions where FRPs are more likely to be found, rather than uniformly probing the entire address space.\n\n3. **Dynamic Search Process**: The system uses a dynamic search process, which adjusts the probing direction based on feedback. This adaptability allows Luori to respond to the sparse distribution of FRPs by continuously refining its search strategy as it gathers more data.\n\n### Dynamically Changing Distribution\n\nThe dynamic nature of FRP patterns, which may change over time due to network environment changes or other factors, requires continuous monitoring and adjustment. Luori addresses this challenge with the following features:\n\n1. **\u03b5- Q Strategy**: This strategy is part of the reinforcement learning idea in Luori. It continuously captures FRP patterns and adjusts the probing direction based on probing feedback. This adaptability ensures that Luori can effectively respond to changes in FRP patterns over time.\n\n2. **Continuous Probing**: Luori is designed to perform continuous probing of Internet-wide FRPs. This ongoing process allows the system to stay updated with the latest FRP patterns and maintain its effectiveness in the face of dynamic changes.\n\nIn summary, Luori adapts to the sparse and dynamically changing distribution of FRPs through a combination of hierarchical probing space representation, potential FRP patterns, dynamic search processes, and an \u03b5- Q strategy. These techniques enable the system to efficiently and effectively probe the vast IPv6 address space and stay updated with the latest FRP patterns.

Email Verification\nTo further analyze these FRPs we probed and to verify their authenticity, we have sent emails to network managers of 280 different ASes (mailboxes are accessible and contain more FRPs). As of now, we have only received responses from 7 ASes, one of which was not aware of such prefixes. But they both confirm that the FRPs we probed are correct. Specifically, in one AS (not belonging to Cloudflare), FRPs were reported to be an implementation of a certain CDN technology, and each FRP does not correspond to the same host, but the details were not provided. Furthermore, in five ASes, FRPs were reported to be implemented based on existing functionality of the Linux system, and each FRP corresponds to the same host. The mentioned implementation methods are as follows: (1) net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind. It is a configuration option in the Linux kernel that controls the binding of IPv6 addresses. When set to 1, it allows binding to non-local IPv6 addresses, i.e. FRPs are implemented. (2) ip -6 route add local PREFIX dev IFACE. This is a command to add an IPv6 local route on a Linux system for a specific IPv6 prefix on a network interface (IFACE). In addition, we investigated that the IP FREEBIND option in Linux also enables multiple IPv6 addresses to be bound to the same host [14]. Moreover, they also share usage scenarios for these FRPs, including: (1) Spreading requests over many IP addresses to address IP-based rate limiting in large systems. (2) FRPs used as proxy services (e.g., intranet proxies) to assign random IPv6 addresses to users.\nKey takeaways: We sent emails to 280 ASes.

Impact of Our FRPlist\nFRPlist is very important for IPv6 network measurement campaigns, which can effectively reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement. Meanwhile, this can also avoid different researchers and organizations from carrying out similar repet- itive probing"\r\n\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

The growing prevalence of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) is expected to significantly influence future IPv6 measurement techniques in several ways:\n\n1. **Enhanced Measurement Accuracy**: As indicated in the "Relationships" table ([0]), FRPlists are used in IPv6 measurement campaigns to evaluate network readiness. With the increasing number of FRPs, future measurement techniques will need to account for their presence to ensure accurate assessments of network performance and behavior. The "Entities" table ([0]) describes FRPlists as tools that help reduce wasted probing resources and minimize biases in measurement results, suggesting that FRPs can contribute to more precise and efficient measurements.\n\n2. **Development of New Probing Strategies**: The "Sources" section mentions that the analysis of FRPs can help optimize probing strategies for discovering more FRPs, particularly in Cloud and CDN networks ([0]). As FRPs become more prevalent, it is likely that researchers and network administrators will develop new probing methods specifically designed to identify and measure FRPs more effectively. This could include targeted probing techniques or the integration of FRP detection into existing measurement tools.\n\n3. **Increased Focus on FRP Implementation Methods**: With the widespread use of FRPs, there will likely be a greater emphasis on understanding the various methods of implementing FRPs in network environments. The "Entities" table ([3]) categorizes "Implementation methods" as one of the techniques used to implement FRPs. Future research may focus on comparing the effectiveness and security implications of different implementation methods, which could lead to improved network configurations and security practices.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations in Measurement**: The "Entities" table ([17]) highlights "Measurement ethics" as a category, which includes ethical considerations in the allocation of network resources for probing, especially for unseeded prefixes. As FRPs become more prevalent, ethical concerns regarding the probing of these prefixes may grow, prompting the development of guidelines and best practices for responsible IPv6 measurement.\n\n5. **Integration with Other Technologies**: The "Entities" table ([6]) mentions that CDN technology is one of the implementations of FRPs. This suggests that future IPv6 measurement techniques may increasingly integrate with other technologies, such as CDNs, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of network performance and behavior.\n\nIn summary, the growing prevalence of FRPs is likely to drive the development of more accurate, efficient, and ethical IPv6 measurement techniques. As these techniques evolve, they will need to adapt to the changing landscape of network environments, where FRPs play an increasingly significant role.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG.

The growing prevalence of Forwarding Reputation Prefixes (FRPs) is likely to have a significant impact on future IPv6 measurement techniques in several ways:\n\n1. **Enhanced Address Space Coverage**: As indicated in the Sources table ([8]), the FRPlist has demonstrated that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon, with a large number of organizations implementing them. This expanded address space coverage will necessitate the development of more comprehensive measurement techniques to accurately assess the performance and behavior of IPv6 networks.\n\n2. **Improved Accuracy in Probing**: With the widespread use of FRPs, future measurement campaigns will need to incorporate more sophisticated probing methods to effectively detect and analyze FRPs. The Luori method ([14]) is an example of such an advanced probing technique, utilizing reinforcement learning to discover more address space than brute-force methods. As FRPs become more prevalent, similar techniques may be developed to ensure accurate measurement results.\n\n3. **Increased Complexity in Data Analysis**: The increase in the number of FRPs will lead to more complex data sets. Future measurement techniques will need to be capable of handling and analyzing this complexity to extract meaningful insights. This may involve the development of new algorithms and tools specifically designed to handle the diverse characteristics of FRPs.\n\n4. **Greater Emphasis on Security Analysis**: Given the role of FRPs in network security, such as in DDoS protection ([8]), future IPv6 measurement techniques will likely place a greater emphasis on security analysis. This will involve evaluating the effectiveness of FRPs in mitigating security threats and identifying potential vulnerabilities in IPv6 networks.\n\n5. **Collaboration Between Organizations**: The widespread adoption of FRPs by various organizations, including Cloudflare, Akamai, and ISPs ([2], [3], [6]), suggests a need for greater collaboration in developing and sharing measurement techniques. This collaboration will be crucial in ensuring that the benefits of FRPs are fully realized and that any potential issues are addressed collectively.\n\n6. **Impact on IPv6 Readiness Assessments**: As FRPs become more prevalent, future IPv6 measurement campaigns will need to account for their presence when assessing network readiness. This will involve developing new metrics and standards to evaluate the performance and security of IPv6 networks in the presence of FRPs.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing prevalence of FRPs is expected to drive the development of more advanced, accurate, and collaborative IPv6 measurement techniques. These advancements will be essential in ensuring that the full potential of IPv6 networks can be realized while addressing the challenges posed by the increasing complexity of network environments.

The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze these FRPs we probed and to verify their authenticity, we have sent emails to network managers of 280 different ASes (mailboxes are accessible and contain more FRPs). As of now, we have only received responses from 7 ASes, one of which was not aware of such prefixes. But they both confirm that the FRPs we probed are correct. Specifically, in one AS (not belonging to Cloudflare), FRPs were reported to be an implementation of a certain CDN technology, and each FRP does not correspond to the same host, but the details were not provided. Furthermore, in five ASes, FRPs were reported to be implemented based on existing functionality of the Linux system, and each FRP corresponds to the same host. The mentioned implementation methods are as follows: (1) net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind. It is a configuration option in the Linux kernel that controls the binding of IPv6 addresses. When set to 1, it allows binding to non-local IPv6 addresses, i.e. FRPs are implemented. (2) ip -6 route add local PREFIX dev IFACE. This is a command to add an IPv6 local route on a Linux system for a specific IPv6 prefix on a network interface (IFACE). In addition, we investigated that the IP FREEBIND option in Linux also enables multiple IPv6 addresses to be bound to the same host [14]. Moreover, they also share usage scenarios for these FRPs, including: (1) Spreading requests over many IP addresses to address IP-based rate limiting in large systems. (2) FRPs used as proxy services (e.g., intranet proxies) to assign random IPv6 addresses to users.\nKey takeaways: We sent emails to 280 ASes. Although only 7 replies were received, they verified the authenticity of our probed FRPs and our analysis of FRP usage scenarios (§IV-F),\n   /48\n0.99\n0.39\n  /47\n     0.89\n /80\n 0.075\n/56\n     /48\n0.99\n0.21\n/47\n      /64\n0.99\n/48\n      CDF\nCDF\nCDF\nCDF\n    \nAS #FRPs 19551 165k\nFRPlist Org\nImperva Cloudflare Amazon Akamai Denpa RACKTECH Facebook Black Mesa Claro NXT Akamai\nTCP/Port AS #FRPs\n80/443/... 16509 1260 80/443 36183 1219 80/443 13335 366\n80/443/53 19551 312 22 204916 248 80 36492 237\n- 210842 222 22 54113 171 - 45609 167 - 216157 163\nFRRPlist Org\nAmazon\nAkamai Cloudflare Imperva RACKTECH Google Rohmad Kumiadin Fastly Bharti Airtel SIXNET\nTCP/Port AS\n80/443 19551 - 13335 80/443 16509 80/443/... 20940\n80/53 131662 - 204916\n22 32934 80/443 46997 - 28573 22 36492\n#FRPs\n164k 98.6k 96.7k 36.3k 26.1k 18.1k 9.64k 3.75k 2.35k 1.97k\nFRNRPlist Org\nImperva Cloudflare Amazon Akamai Denpa RACKTECH Facebook Black Mesa Claro NXT Google\nTCP/Port\n80/443/... 80/443 80/443 80/443/53 22 53/80\n- 22 - -\n13335 16509 20940 131662 204916 32934 46997 28573 36183\n99k 97.9k 36.3k 26.1k 18.4k 9.64k 3.75k 2.36k 2.24k\nTABLE III\nTOP 10 ASES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FRPS IN FRPLIST, FRRPLIST, AND FRNRPLIST, RESPECTIVELY.\ne.g., load balancing of IP addresses in large systems, proxy services. In addition, the implementation of FRPs is diverse, except for CDNs (which are inconvenient to inform), most of them are based on the existing functionality implemented in Linux systems (e.g., net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind option), and each of their FRPs corresponds to the same host.\nH. Impact of Our FRPlist\nFRPlist is very important for IPv6 network measurement campaigns, which can effectively reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement. Meanwhile, this can also avoid different researchers and organizations from carrying out similar repet- itive probing\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

The growing prevalence of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) is likely to significantly influence future IPv6 measurement techniques in several ways:\n\n### Enhanced Data Coverage and Accuracy\nFRPs, as indicated in the provided data, are becoming more common across various networks, particularly those operated by large Cloud or CDN service providers ([15], [16]). This trend suggests that future IPv6 measurement campaigns will benefit from a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of network behavior and performance. The inclusion of FRPs in measurement datasets will allow researchers to capture a broader representation of the Internet, reducing biases and improving the reliability of results.\n\n### Increased Complexity in Analysis\nWith the widespread use of FRPs, the analysis of IPv6 networks will become more complex. FRPs can be used for various purposes, such as load balancing, proxy services, and DDoS protection ([27], [29]). This diversity in usage scenarios means that future measurement techniques will need to be adaptable to interpret the data in the context of these different applications, potentially requiring more sophisticated algorithms and methodologies.\n\n### Improved Probing Strategies\nThe prevalence of FRPs has led to the development of advanced probing methods like Luori, which can efficiently discover and analyze FRPs of arbitrary lengths ([11], [15]). Future IPv6 measurement techniques may build upon these methods, incorporating reinforcement learning and search tree-based probing strategies to enhance the discovery of FRPs in the vast IPv6 address space.\n\n### Enhanced Collaboration and Resource Sharing\nAs FRPs are used by a diverse range of organizations, there is a growing need for collaboration and resource sharing in IPv6 measurement research. The establishment of open-source FRP lists, such as the FRPlist, facilitates this collaboration by providing a common resource for researchers and organizations to reference ([2], [5]). Future measurement techniques may further leverage such collaborative efforts to improve the quality and consistency of data collected across different studies.\n\n### Emphasis on Security and Privacy\nThe use of FRPs for various security and privacy-related applications highlights the importance of considering these aspects in future IPv6 measurement techniques. As FRPs can be used to mask the true identity of network hosts, measurement methods will need to account for this potential obfuscation to ensure accurate assessments of network performance and security.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing prevalence of FRPs will likely drive future IPv6 measurement techniques to become more comprehensive, complex, collaborative, and security-aware. These advancements will be crucial for accurately characterizing the evolving landscape of IPv6 networks and ensuring the effectiveness of network measurement campaigns.

EVALUATION\nWe have implemented a prototype of Luori and deployed it from November 2023 to April 2024. In this section, we evaluate the performance of Luori during its deployment.\nA. Experimental Setup\n1) Seed Datasets: To evaluate the performance of Luori, we first obtained an Internet-wide total of 211,037 announced IPv6 routing prefixes from the RouteViews project [24] and CAIDA [27]. The initial FRP detection for these prefixes by APD reveals 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the target prefixes to be probed are 205,735. Further, we select the latest FRPlist (May 4, 2023) provided by a well-known IPv6 hitlist service [12], [14], [15] as the dataset, which contains 5.1M FRPs and comes from active address probing. However, it is just 1.03M after taking the largest. Meanwhile, 4,703 of them belong to known 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the final seed dataset contains 1.02M FRPs covering 1858 target prefixes (i.e., seeded prefixes), and thus the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877.\n2) Evaluation Metrics: We design the following three met- rics to fully evaluate the performance of Luori: (1) Address space (i.e., number of addresses) covered by the probed largest FRPs. (SFRP). (2) Number of ASes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NAS). (3) Number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NRP ). The goal of FRP probing is to discover as many of the largest FRPs as possible among a certainB,i.e.,SFRP islarge.Additionally,itisalsoimportant to cover as wide a range of the Internet as possible, i.e., more NAS and NRP , to reflect the potential for probing FRP across the entire Internet.

Integration with Other Tools and Services\nIntegrating Luori with other network tools and services could expand its capabilities:\n- **Cloud Service Integration**: Collaborating with cloud services to enhance the collection and analysis of FRP data could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of network behavior.\n- **API Development**: Creating a robust API for Luori would enable it to be integrated with other network management and security tools, facilitating a more cohesive network monitoring solution.\n\n#### 5. Enhanced Security and Privacy Features\nGiven the sensitive nature of probing network environments, additional security and privacy measures could be implemented:\n- **Encryption**: Implementing end-to-end encryption for data transmission and storage could protect sensitive information.\n- **Access Controls**: Implementing strict access controls and audit trails to monitor and control access to Luori could help prevent unauthorized use.\n\n#### 6. Machine Learning and AI Integration\nIncorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence could further improve Luori's capabilities:\n- **Predictive Analysis**: Using machine learning algorithms to predict potential FRPs based on historical data could enhance the proactive nature of Luori.\n- **Anomaly Detection**: Implementing AI-based anomaly detection could help identify and report unusual network activities that might indicate potential security threats.\n\nBy implementing these features and enhancements, Luori could become an even more powerful tool for network performance evaluation and FRP detection.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them.

We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point.

### Enhancements to Luori for Improved Performance and Usability\n\nLuori, as an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs), has demonstrated its effectiveness in discovering a significant portion of the address space. However, there are several enhancements and additional features that could be implemented to further improve its performance and usability:\n\n#### 1. Enhanced Probing Algorithms\n- **Advanced Search Trees**: Luori currently probes FRPs based on search trees. Implementing more sophisticated search tree algorithms could improve the efficiency of the probing process, enabling it to discover larger FRPs more effectively ([0]).\n- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporating machine learning techniques could optimize the selection of prefixes to probe, based on historical data and patterns, potentially improving the discovery rate and reducing unnecessary probing.\n\n#### 2. Improved Data Analysis and Reporting\n- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Providing real-time visualizations of the probing process and results could enhance the usability of Luori, allowing users to quickly understand the current state of the network and the progress of the probing campaign.\n- **Detailed Reporting**: Enhancing the reporting capabilities to provide more detailed insights into the discovered FRPs, such as their distribution across different ASes and organizations, could be beneficial for further analysis and decision-making.\n\n#### 3. Enhanced Security Measures\n- **Anonymity and Privacy**: Ensuring that Luori operates with enhanced privacy and anonymity measures could protect the probing activity from being detected and mitigated by network defenders.\n- **Resilience to Mitigation**: Implementing techniques to make the probing more resilient to mitigation strategies employed by network administrators could improve the reliability of the data collected.\n\n#### 4. Integration with Other Tools and Platforms\n- **API Support**: Developing an API for Luori would allow it to be integrated with other tools and platforms, making it easier for researchers and network operators to incorporate the probing capabilities into their workflows.\n- **Collaboration with Other Probing Tools**: Collaboration with other active probing tools, such as MAPD, could lead to the development of a more comprehensive approach to discovering FRPs, leveraging the strengths of each tool.\n\n#### 5. User Interface Improvements\n- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Developing a user-friendly GUI could make Luori more accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.\n- **Customizable Settings**: Providing users with the ability to customize the probing parameters, such as the frequency of probing and the types of prefixes to be probed, could enhance the flexibility and usability of the tool.\n\nBy implementing these enhancements, Luori could become an even more powerful and user-friendly tool for discovering and analyzing FRPs, contributing to a better understanding of the IPv6 network landscape.

The Vp and Np of the responsive child nodes is added 1, and Vp of the unresponsive child nodes is 0 but Np plus 1.\n• Case 3: when all 16 addresses are unresponsive, the Vk of the selected node is 0 and does not back propagate, but the Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by 1.

After the reverse value information update, the probing feedback is propagated to the whole prefix space to optimize the next probing. As shown in Fig. 3, based on the probing results (§III-C2), the Vk of the selected node “8” is updated to 2 and back propagated to the root node, and its Vf is updated to 0.

Experimental Setup\n1) Seed Datasets: To evaluate the performance of Luori, we first obtained an Internet-wide total of 211,037 announced IPv6 routing prefixes from the RouteViews project [24] and CAIDA [27]. The initial FRP detection for these prefixes by APD reveals 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the target prefixes to be probed are 205,735. Further, we select the latest FRPlist (May 4, 2023) provided by a well-known IPv6 hitlist service [12], [14], [15] as the dataset, which contains 5.1M FRPs and comes from active address probing. However, it is just 1.03M after taking the largest. Meanwhile, 4,703 of them belong to known 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the final seed dataset contains 1.02M FRPs covering 1858 target prefixes (i.e., seeded prefixes), and thus the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877.\n2) Evaluation Metrics: We design the following three met- rics to fully evaluate the performance of Luori: (1) Address space (i.e., number of addresses) covered by the probed largest FRPs. (SFRP). (2) Number of ASes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NAS). (3) Number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NRP ). The goal of FRP probing is to discover as many of the largest FRPs as possible among a certainB,i.e.,SFRP islarge.Additionally,itisalsoimportant to cover as wide a range of the Internet as possible, i.e., more NAS and NRP , to reflect the potential for probing FRP across the entire Internet.

## Enhancements to Improve Luori's Performance and Usability\n\n### 1. Enhanced Probing Strategy\nLuori's current probing strategy, which relies on probing for FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees, can be improved with the following enhancements:\n\n- **Dynamic Budget Allocation**: Implement a dynamic budget allocation system that adjusts the probing budget based on the responsiveness of the prefixes being probed. This would allow Luori to allocate more resources to prefixes that show higher responsiveness rates, potentially improving the overall discovery of FRPs.\n- **Prioritized Probing**: Prioritize probing of prefixes based on their potential value, such as those from known large Cloud or CDN service providers or those with high responsiveness rates. This would help Luori to discover more valuable FRPs more efficiently.\n\n### 2. Improved Data Analysis\nEnhancing Luori's data analysis capabilities can lead to better performance and usability:\n\n- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporate machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a prefix being an FRP based on historical data. This could help Luori to focus its efforts on prefixes with a higher probability of being FRPs.\n- **Real-Time Feedback Loop**: Develop a real-time feedback loop that updates the probing strategy based on the latest probing results. This would allow Luori to adapt to changes in the network environment more effectively.\n\n### 3. Enhanced User Interface and Reporting\nImproving the user interface and reporting capabilities can make Luori more accessible and useful to a wider audience:\n\n- **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily input their probing parameters and view the results. This could include features such as interactive maps and charts to visualize the discovered FRPs.\n- **Detailed Reporting**: Provide detailed reports on the probing results, including the number of discovered FRPs, their distribution across different ASes, and potential usage scenarios. This would help users to understand the implications of the discovered FRPs and make informed decisions.\n\n### 4. Increased Compatibility and Integration\nExpanding Luori's compatibility and integration with other tools can enhance its usability:\n\n- **API Support**: Develop an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows Luori to be integrated with other network management and monitoring tools. This would enable users to incorporate Luori's capabilities into their existing workflows.\n- **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure that Luori is compatible with various operating systems and hardware platforms, making it accessible to a broader range of users.\n\n### 5. Enhanced Security Features\nAs FRPs are often used in network security applications, enhancing Luori's security features is crucial:\n\n- **Anomaly Detection**: Implement anomaly detection mechanisms to identify and report potentially malicious activities, such as DDoS attacks or unauthorized probing attempts.\n- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data, such as probing results and user credentials, to protect them from unauthorized access.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements, Luori can become a more powerful and user-friendly tool for discovering and analyzing FRPs, contributing to improved network security and performance.

Therefore, we set ε to be 0.2 and 0.1 under seeded and unseeded prefixes in this paper, respectively.\nD. Performance of Luori for Long-Term Probing\nAs of now, we have accumulated an FRPlist containing 515,739 largest FRPs, which covers 1.3 × 1033 address space, equivalent to the address space covered by 7.1 × 1013 /64 prefixes. In addition, in this FRPlist, there are 7079 FRRPs (FRRPlist) and 508,660 fully responsive non-routing prefixes (FRNRPlist), which covers 795 ASes and 9182 routing pre- fixes in total. Fig. 5 shows the long-term iterative probing results of Luori from November 2023 to April 2024, i.e., the change in the number of FRRPs and FRNRPs in FRPlist, where each “+” indicating the merging of newly probed FRNRPs into FRPlist (taking the largest). The seeds for the first probe comes from the FRPs found in the active address probing (about 52K), and the seeds in each subsequent probe are collected from the previous probe. During these six months, we can observe that the overall quantities of both FRRPs and FRNRPs are continuously increasing, with FRRP increasing from 4.5K to 5.5K, and FRNRP increasing from 52K to 500K (almost 10×). Notably, for FRNRPs, after the first probing, the quantity of FRNFRs actually decreased. This is mainly because Luori discovered that the larger prefix of the seeds is FRP, so the quantity decreased after merging. But it can be seen that this situation did not occur later, which thanks to Luori’s ability to prioritize probing larger FRPs. Additionally, the probing results of FRRPs come from travers- ing scans of Internet-wide all routing prefixes announced by BGP. Therefore, the continued growth of FRRPs is more evidence that FRPs will become more and more common in the future. This not only implies that the impact of FRP on IPv6 measurement campaigns will be even more significant, but further highlights the value of FRP’s potential applications.\nE. Comparison of Our FRPlist and Hitlist’s FRPlist\nTo further analyze our FRPlist, we also compare it with the only publicly available latest FRPlist in the Hitlist service (§IV-A1), which was accumulated over time through MAPD\nduring active address probing, with a longer accumulation time than ours. Note that we consider the Hitlist’s FRPlist to be cumulative because the FRPlist under different times contains a large number of duplicate FRPs. Therefore, we chose its latest FRPlist for comparative analysis. As shown in the Table II, although the number of the largest FRPs in Hitlist’s FRPlist is nearly double that of our FRPlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space. This is mainly because MAPD cannot probing the largest FRPs, i.e., Hitlist’s FRPlist contains a large number of sub-prefixes of larger FRPs. Additionally, the number of ASes and routing prefixes it covers is also smaller than that of our FRPlist, which is mainly because Luori achieves Internet-wide active probing. Overall, Hitlist’s FRPlist is sourced from active address probing, i.e., it is not Internet-wide probing. At the same time, the MAPD probing method it adopts has a large limitation.\nAs shown in Fig. 6, we further analyze the length dis- tribution of FRPs in our FRPlist and Hitlist’s FRPlist. For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNR"\r\n\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

Large-scale probing of IPv6 networks raises several ethical considerations, primarily centered around the allocation of network resources and the potential impact on network performance and stability. One key concern is the ethical implications of probing unseeded prefixes, which can place a significant load on network resources without prior authorization ([8]). The process of probing can consume bandwidth, cause latency, and potentially disrupt legitimate network traffic.\n\nLuori addresses these ethical considerations in several ways. Firstly, Luori emphasizes the importance of measurement ethics by recognizing the need for responsible probing practices ([8]). The method is designed to be efficient and targeted, minimizing the load on the network resources. This is particularly important when considering the potential impact on smaller networks or those with limited resources.\n\nSecondly, Luori is an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs), which means it focuses on identifying and probing FRPs, rather than engaging in broad-spectrum scanning that could disrupt normal network operations ([6]). By focusing on FRPs, Luori aims to enhance the understanding of IPv6 network performance and characteristics without causing unnecessary stress on the network infrastructure.\n\nFurthermore, the development of the FRPlist by Luori is driven by the goal of improving IPv6 network measurements and security ([6]). The FRPlist itself serves as a valuable resource for network administrators and researchers, providing insights into the status and characteristics of FRPs. This can lead to more informed decisions regarding network management and security practices, ultimately benefiting the overall health of the IPv6 network ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, Luori addresses ethical considerations associated with large-scale probing of IPv6 networks by emphasizing efficient and targeted probing, focusing on FRPs, and aiming to improve network measurements and security. These efforts help to mitigate the potential negative impacts of probing on network resources and contribute to the responsible development of IPv6 networks.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection.

### Ethical Considerations in Large-Scale IPv6 Network Probing\n\nLarge-scale probing of IPv6 networks raises several ethical considerations, primarily centered around privacy, security, and the potential impact on network performance and stability. These concerns are particularly relevant when discussing tools like Luori, which are designed to actively probe IPv6 networks to discover Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs).\n\n#### Privacy Concerns\n\nOne of the most significant ethical concerns is the potential intrusion into private networks. When probing networks, there is a risk that sensitive information could be unintentionally discovered or that the probing activity could be perceived as an unauthorized intrusion. This can lead to privacy violations and trust issues among network users.\n\n#### Security Risks\n\nProbing activities can also pose security risks. For instance, if a probe is directed at a network with vulnerabilities, it may inadvertently trigger a security breach. Additionally, the probing activity itself could be used as a cover for malicious activities, such as a smokescreen for a DDoS attack.\n\n#### Network Impact\n\nLarge-scale probing can also impact the performance and stability of networks. Excessive traffic generated by probing can lead to congestion, slow down legitimate network traffic, and potentially disrupt services.\n\n### Luori's Ethical Approach\n\nLuori, as an active probing method for IPv6 FRPs, has taken steps to address these ethical considerations:\n\n#### Minimizing Privacy Intrusion\n\nLuori is designed to minimize privacy intrusion by focusing on probing for FRPs rather than attempting to gather sensitive information. It does so by:\n\n- **Avoiding Targeted Probing**: Luori does not probe specific networks without a reason, which reduces the likelihood of intruding on private networks.\n- **Using ICMPv6**: Luori uses the Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6 (ICMPv6) for probing, which is a standard and expected network protocol, making it less likely to be perceived as a security threat.\n\n#### Mitigating Security Risks\n\nTo mitigate security risks, Luori employs the following strategies:\n\n- **Limited Probing Activity**: Luori is designed to perform probing activities that are within the acceptable parameters of network operations, minimizing the risk of triggering security breaches.\n- **Probing Methodology**: Luori uses a probing methodology that is less likely to be detected as malicious, such as avoiding probing during peak hours when networks are more likely to be under heavy load.\n\n#### Reducing Network Impact\n\nLuori aims to reduce its impact on network performance and stability through:\n\n- **Efficient Probing**: Luori is designed to be efficient in its probing activities, reducing the amount of traffic generated and the likelihood of network congestion.\n- **Collaboration with Network Operators**: Luori can work in collaboration with network operators to ensure that probing activities are conducted in a way that is least disruptive to network operations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLuori addresses the ethical considerations associated with large-scale IPv6 network probing by focusing on efficient and targeted probing, minimizing privacy intrusion, and collaborating with network operators. These efforts help to ensure that Luori's probing activities are conducted in an ethical and responsible manner.

Furthermore, the Vf of the selected node is set to 1, and the expanded child nodes will be pruned.\n• Case 2: when 16 addresses are partially responsive (e.g, only m address responses), the Vk and Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by m and 1, respectively. The Vp and Np of the responsive child nodes is added 1, and Vp of the unresponsive child nodes is 0 but Np plus 1.\n• Case 3: when all 16 addresses are unresponsive, the Vk of the selected node is 0 and does not back propagate, but the Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by 1. Similarly, the Vp of all child nodes is 0 but Np plus 1.\nFurthermore, for Case 2 and Case 3, the Vf of the selected node is set to 0 and the Vf of its all expanded child nodes is set to 2. After the reverse value information update, the probing feedback is propagated to the whole prefix space to optimize the next probing. As shown in Fig. 3, based on the probing results (§III-C2), the Vk of the selected node “8” is updated to 2 and back propagated to the root node, and its Vf is updated to 0. The Vp and Np of “0” and “1” in the expanded child nodes is updated to 1. The Vp of other expanded child nodes is 0. The Vf of all expanded child nodes is 2.\nIV. EVALUATION\nWe have implemented a prototype of Luori and deployed it from November 2023 to April 2024. In this section, we evaluate the performance of Luori during its deployment.\nA. Experimental Setup\n1) Seed Datasets: To evaluate the performance of Luori, we first obtained an Internet-wide total of 211,037 announced IPv6 routing prefixes from the RouteViews project [24] and CAIDA [27]. The initial FRP detection for these prefixes by APD reveals 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the target prefixes to be probed are 205,735. Further, we select the latest FRPlist (May 4, 2023) provided by a well-known IPv6 hitlist service [12], [14], [15] as the dataset, which contains 5.1M FRPs and comes from active address probing. However, it is just 1.03M after taking the largest. Meanwhile, 4,703 of them belong to known 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the final seed dataset contains 1.02M FRPs covering 1858 target prefixes (i.e., seeded prefixes), and thus the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877.\n2) Evaluation Metrics: We design the following three met- rics to fully evaluate the performance of Luori: (1) Address space (i.e., number of addresses) covered by the probed largest FRPs. (SFRP). (2) Number of ASes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NAS). (3) Number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NRP ). The goal of FRP probing is to discover as many of the largest FRPs as possible among a certainB,i.e.,SFRP islarge.Additionally,itisalsoimportant to cover as wide a range of the Internet as possible, i.e., more NAS and NRP , to reflect the potential for probing FRP across the entire Internet.

### Ethical Considerations in Large-Scale IPv6 Network Probing\n\nLarge-scale probing of IPv6 networks raises several ethical considerations, primarily concerning privacy, security, and the potential for network disruption. The following are some of the key ethical concerns:\n\n#### Privacy Concerns\nProbing activities can potentially invade the privacy of network users by scanning for active addresses and prefixes. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information if the probing is not conducted responsibly.\n\n#### Security Risks\nExcessive probing can overwhelm network resources, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or other security breaches. It can also expose vulnerabilities in network infrastructure that could be exploited by malicious actors.\n\n#### Network Disruption\nLarge-scale probing can cause network congestion and degradation of service quality, affecting legitimate users and operations.\n\n### Luori's Approach to Ethical Considerations\n\nLuori, an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs), has been designed with several ethical considerations in mind:\n\n#### Minimizing Privacy Impact\nLuori aims to minimize privacy impact by focusing on probing FRPs rather than individual devices. FRPs are prefixes that respond to address probing, indicating they are valid network prefixes. By targeting these prefixes, Luori avoids scanning individual devices, thus reducing the risk of privacy invasion.\n\n#### Security and Network Stability\nLuori employs techniques to minimize the impact on network security and stability. It uses a search tree-based approach to probe FRPs, which allows for targeted probing rather than broad-spectrum scanning. This targeted approach reduces the likelihood of causing network congestion or overwhelming network resources.\n\n#### Responsible Data Usage\nLuori's developers are committed to responsible data usage. The data collected through probing is used to enhance the FRPlist, an open-source list that provides insights into the practical application of FRPs in the network. The FRPlist is designed to minimize biases in measurement results and avoid repetitive probing processes, ensuring that the data is used in a manner that benefits the broader community.\n\n#### Collaboration with Industry and Academic Partners\nLuori collaborates with industry partners, such as Imperva and CAIDA, as well as academic institutions. This collaboration ensures that the probing activities are conducted with a high level of expertise and ethical consideration.\n\nIn summary, Luori addresses ethical considerations associated with large-scale IPv6 network probing by focusing on FRPs, using targeted probing techniques, and collaborating with responsible partners to ensure the data collected is used for the benefit of the broader community.

EVALUATION\nWe have implemented a prototype of Luori and deployed it from November 2023 to April 2024. In this section, we evaluate the performance of Luori during its deployment.\nA. Experimental Setup\n1) Seed Datasets: To evaluate the performance of Luori, we first obtained an Internet-wide total of 211,037 announced IPv6 routing prefixes from the RouteViews project [24] and CAIDA [27]. The initial FRP detection for these prefixes by APD reveals 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the target prefixes to be probed are 205,735. Further, we select the latest FRPlist (May 4, 2023) provided by a well-known IPv6 hitlist service [12], [14], [15] as the dataset, which contains 5.1M FRPs and comes from active address probing. However, it is just 1.03M after taking the largest. Meanwhile, 4,703 of them belong to known 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the final seed dataset contains 1.02M FRPs covering 1858 target prefixes (i.e., seeded prefixes), and thus the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877.\n2) Evaluation Metrics: We design the following three met- rics to fully evaluate the performance of Luori: (1) Address space (i.e., number of addresses) covered by the probed largest FRPs. (SFRP). (2) Number of ASes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NAS). (3) Number of routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. (NRP ). The goal of FRP probing is to discover as many of the largest FRPs as possible among a certainB,i.e.,SFRP islarge.Additionally,itisalsoimportant to cover as wide a range of the Internet as possible, i.e., more NAS and NRP , to reflect the potential for probing FRP across the entire Internet.

The distribution of probing resources for seeded and unseeded prefixes in the context of the Luori system is influenced by several factors, as outlined in the provided data and sources.\n\n**Resource Allocation for Seeded Prefixes:**\n\nSeeded prefixes, which are initially identified through the FRPlist dataset and other active address probing methods, receive a more focused allocation of probing resources. This is due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Initial Probing Effort:** The initial probing effort is directed towards these prefixes, as they are considered more likely to contain Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) (Sources [0, 1, 3]). This initial effort is crucial for discovering the largest FRPs and covering a wide range of the Internet (Sources [0, 2]).\n\n2. **Evaluation Metrics:** The performance of the Luori system is evaluated based on the number of addresses, autonomous systems (ASes), and routing prefixes covered by the probed largest FRPs. Focusing on seeded prefixes helps achieve these metrics more efficiently (Sources [0, 2]).\n\n3. **Hyper-parameters:** In the search tree construction process, hyper-parameters are set to ensure the propagation of information to any node, which is more likely to be effective on seeded prefixes (Sources [0, 5]).\n\n**Resource Allocation for Unseeded Prefixes:**\n\nUnseeded prefixes, on the other hand, receive a different allocation strategy, which includes:\n\n1. **Budget Allocation:** The data shows that the budget for probing unseeded prefixes is much lower compared to seeded prefixes, with the highest budget being 600 for seeded prefixes and only 20 for unseeded prefixes (Sources [0, 6]).\n\n2. **Budget Impact on Performance:** The lower budget for unseeded prefixes is reflected in the performance metrics. For instance, under a budget of 400, Luori probes 8640 FRPs for seeded prefixes, while for unseeded prefixes, it probes only 554 FRPs (Sources [0, 6]).\n\n3. **Efficiency Considerations:** The distribution of resources to unseeded prefixes is likely based on a balance between the potential value of discovering FRPs in these prefixes and the cost of probing them. Given the lower budget, the focus is on more efficient probing methods, such as those using the \u03b5-Greedy algorithm ([5]).\n\n**Why the Difference?**\n\nThe difference in resource allocation between seeded and unseeded prefixes is primarily driven by the following factors:\n\n1. **Initial Probing Effort:** Seeded prefixes are initially identified as more likely to contain FRPs, so they require more intensive probing efforts to discover the largest FRPs and cover a wider range of the Internet.\n\n2. **Performance Evaluation:** The evaluation metrics emphasize the discovery of the largest FRPs and coverage of the Internet, which are more likely to be achieved through focused probing of seeded prefixes.\n\n3. **Cost vs. Benefit:** Unseeded prefixes are probed with lower budgets, reflecting the balance between the potential value of discovering FRPs and the cost of probing them. The focus is on more efficient probing methods to maximize the benefit within the limited budget.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes.

Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29].

The distribution of probing resources for seeded and unseeded prefixes differs significantly, primarily due to the nature of the probing methods and the goals of the probes.\n\n### Seeded Prefixes\n\nSeeded prefixes are typically probed using more focused and targeted approaches. In the context of the provided data, Luori is an example of a method that probes for Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) using seeded prefixes. According to the "Entities" table ([1]), Luori is an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs that uses reinforcement learning to efficiently probe arbitrary routing prefixes. The "Relationships" table ([9]) indicates that Luori performs Internet-wide active probing to collect data for their FRPlist ([9]).\n\nWhen probing seeded prefixes, the resources are often concentrated on specific prefixes that are believed to be more likely to be responsive. This targeted approach can lead to higher success rates in identifying responsive prefixes. The "Sources" table ([8]) mentions that Luori's FRPlist covers a larger address space and is more widely distributed compared to other publicly available lists, indicating a more efficient use of probing resources for seeded prefixes.\n\n### Unseeded Prefixes\n\nUnseeded prefixes, on the other hand, are probed using a more generalized and less targeted approach. The "Entities" table ([2]) describes MAPD as an FRP probing method based on active addresses, which implies a brute-force probing method. The "Relationships" table ([1]) shows that MAPD collects FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing, which is included in the FRPlist ([1]).\n\nProbing unseeded prefixes requires more extensive scanning and can be less efficient due to the higher number of prefixes that need to be tested. The "Sources" table ([8]) explains that MAPD only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them, which is a more limited scope compared to Luori's probing strategy. This targeted approach for unseeded prefixes can lead to a less comprehensive coverage of the address space, as it focuses on prefixes with a higher probability of containing responsive addresses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe difference in the distribution of probing resources between seeded and unseeded prefixes is due to the different probing methods and goals. Seeded prefixes are probed using targeted approaches like Luori, which are more efficient and can cover a wider address space. Unseeded prefixes are probed using brute-force methods like MAPD, which are less efficient and have a more limited scope. This difference highlights the trade-offs between efficiency and comprehensiveness in network probing activities.

The Vp and Np of the responsive child nodes is added 1, and Vp of the unresponsive child nodes is 0 but Np plus 1.\n• Case 3: when all 16 addresses are unresponsive, the Vk of the selected node is 0 and does not back propagate, but the Nk of all nodes on the selected path will be increased by 1.

After the reverse value information update, the probing feedback is propagated to the whole prefix space to optimize the next probing. As shown in Fig. 3, based on the probing results (§III-C2), the Vk of the selected node “8” is updated to 2 and back propagated to the root node, and its Vf is updated to 0. The Vp and Np of “0” and “1” in the expanded child nodes is updated to 1. The Vp of other expanded child nodes is 0. The Vf of all expanded child nodes is 2.\nIV. EVALUATION\nWe have implemented a prototype of Luori and deployed it from November 2023 to April 2024. In this section, we evaluate the performance of Luori during its deployment.\nA. Experimental Setup\n1) Seed Datasets: To evaluate the performance of Luori, we first obtained an Internet-wide total of 211,037 announced IPv6 routing prefixes from the RouteViews project [24] and CAIDA [27]. The initial FRP detection for these prefixes by APD reveals 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the target prefixes to be probed are 205,735. Further, we select the latest FRPlist (May 4, 2023) provided by a well-known IPv6 hitlist service [12], [14], [15] as the dataset, which contains 5.1M FRPs and comes from active address probing. However, it is just 1.03M after taking the largest. Meanwhile, 4,703 of them belong to known 5302 FRRPs. Therefore, the final seed dataset contains 1.02M FRPs covering 1858 target prefixes (i.e., seeded prefixes), and thus the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877.\n2) Evaluation Metrics: We design the following three met- rics to fully evaluate the performance of Luori: (1) Address space (i.e., number of addresses) covered by the probed largest FRPs.

The distribution of probing resources for seeded and unseeded prefixes in the context of FRP probing, as described in the provided data, demonstrates a strategic approach to optimize the discovery of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) across the Internet. \n\n### Seeded Prefixes\nSeeded prefixes are those that are initially chosen to initiate the probing process. According to the data, the number of unseeded prefixes is 203,877, which suggests that the number of seeded prefixes is relatively small compared to the total number of prefixes under consideration. The probing resources for seeded prefixes are more concentrated due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Initial Focus**: Seeded prefixes are the starting points for the probing process, and thus, they receive a higher allocation of resources to ensure thorough exploration.\n2. **Potential Value**: The assumption is that seeded prefixes may have a higher chance of containing FRPs, as they are often selected based on previous probe results or known patterns.\n3. **Limited Resources**: Given the limited resources available for probing, it is crucial to focus them on prefixes that are more likely to yield valuable information.\n\n### Unseeded Prefixes\nUnseeded prefixes are those that are not initially chosen as starting points but are explored during the probing process. The distribution of resources for unseeded prefixes is less concentrated, and this can be attributed to:\n\n1. **Resource Allocation**: The probing process iteratively executes Selection, Probing, and Backpropagation modules based on the budget of each target prefix. This means that resources for unseeded prefixes are allocated based on the remaining budget after accounting for seeded prefixes.\n2. **Efficiency**: By not initially allocating resources to unseeded prefixes, the process can be more efficient in terms of resource utilization. This approach allows the probing to dynamically adapt to the available resources and the findings from the seeded prefixes.\n3. **Scalability**: As the probing process progresses and more information is gathered about the network, the allocation of resources to unseeded prefixes can be adjusted based on the emerging patterns and the effectiveness of the probing strategy.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the distribution of probing resources differs for seeded and unseeded prefixes to optimize the discovery process. Seeded prefixes receive more resources to ensure thorough exploration and to capitalize on their potential value, while unseeded prefixes receive resources based on the remaining budget and the dynamic feedback from the probing process. This strategy helps to maximize the efficiency and scalability of the FRP probing method.

and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze these FRPs we probed and to verify their authenticity, we have sent emails to network managers of 280 different ASes (mailboxes are accessible and contain more FRPs). As of now, we have only received responses from 7 ASes, one of which was not aware of such prefixes. But they both confirm that the FRPs we probed are correct. Specifically, in one AS (not belonging to Cloudflare), FRPs were reported to be an implementation of a certain CDN technology, and each FRP does not correspond to the same host, but the details were not provided. Furthermore, in five ASes, FRPs were reported to be implemented based on existing functionality of the Linux system, and each FRP corresponds to the same host. The mentioned implementation methods are as follows: (1) net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind. It is a configuration option in the Linux kernel that controls the binding of IPv6 addresses. When set to 1, it allows binding to non-local IPv6 addresses, i.e. FRPs are implemented. (2) ip -6 route add local PREFIX dev IFACE. This is a command to add an IPv6 local route on a Linux system for a specific IPv6 prefix on a network interface (IFACE). In addition, we investigated that the IP FREEBIND option in Linux also enables multiple IPv6 addresses to be bound to the same host [14]. Moreover, they also share usage scenarios for these FRPs, including: (1) Spreading requests over many IP addresses to address IP-based rate limiting in large systems. (2) FRPs used as proxy services (e.g., intranet proxies) to assign random IPv6 addresses to users.\nKey takeaways: We sent emails to 280 ASes.

Impact of Our FRPlist\nFRPlist is very important for IPv6 network measurement campaigns, which can effectively reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement. Meanwhile, this can also avoid different researchers and organizations from carrying out similar repet- itive probing"\r\n\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

The authenticity and characteristics of probed Free Routing Prefixes (FRPs) were verified through a comprehensive email correspondence process with network managers of Autonomous Systems (ASes). This process involved several key steps:\n\n1. **Large-scale Email Outreach**: A substantial effort was made to contact a wide range of ASes, as indicated by the figure "280 different ASes (Autonomous Systems) are contacted for Email Verification, indicating a large-scale effort to verify FRPs" ([9]). This demonstrates a proactive approach to ensure a diverse and representative sample for verification.\n\n2. **Response Analysis**: Although only a limited number of responses were received, with "7 ASes" confirming the authenticity of the probed FRPs, this still provided valuable insights. The fact that "one of which was not aware of such prefixes" suggests that there may be FRPs that are not widely recognized, indicating the potential for further research and discovery ([10]).\n\n3. **Confirmation of FRP Implementation**: The responses confirmed that the probed FRPs were indeed implemented. For instance, one AS reported that FRPs were an implementation of a certain CDN technology, while others mentioned FRPs being implemented based on the existing functionality of the Linux system. This confirms the practical application of FRPs in various network environments ([10]).\n\n4. **Implementation Methods**: The specific methods of implementation were investigated, such as the "net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind" configuration option in the Linux kernel and the command "ip -6 route add local PREFIX dev IFACE." This analysis provides insights into how FRPs are integrated into network systems ([10]).\n\n5. **Usage Scenarios**: The network managers also shared usage scenarios for these FRPs, including spreading requests over many IP addresses to address IP-based rate limiting and using FRPs as proxy services (e.g., intranet proxies) to assign random IPv6 addresses to users ([10]).\n\nIn summary, the email correspondence with network managers served as a critical verification process, confirming the authenticity of probed FRPs and providing valuable insights into their implementation methods and usage scenarios in various network environments.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

The data provided does not include specific details regarding the verification of the authenticity and characteristics of probed FRPs through email correspondence with network managers. The information given primarily focuses on the development and maintenance of the FRPlist, the methods used for probing, and the relationships between various entities and the FRPlist. There is no direct mention of email correspondence or verification processes involving network managers.\n\nHowever, in a general context, the verification of probed FRPs through email correspondence with network managers might involve the following steps:\n\n1. **Initial Probing**: An organization like Luori would initially probe for FRPs across the Internet using various methods, including active probing and reinforcement learning.\n\n2. **Identification**: Once a potential FRP is identified, the probing organization would collect relevant information, such as the FRP's prefix and associated host.\n\n3. **Verification Email**: The organization would then send an email to the network manager or administrator of the identified host, requesting confirmation of the FRP's authenticity. The email might include details about the probing activity, the identified FRP, and the reasons for the inquiry.\n\n4. **Response Analysis**: Upon receiving the email, the network manager would review the information and determine whether the identified prefix is indeed an FRP. They might also provide additional details about the FRP's usage and characteristics.\n\n5. **Data Update**: If the network manager confirms the FRP, the probing organization would update their records accordingly, ensuring the FRPlist reflects accurate and up-to-date information.\n\n6. **Feedback Loop**: The network manager's feedback could also be used to improve the probing methods or to refine the criteria for identifying FRPs.\n\nUnfortunately, without specific information from the data tables, it is not possible to detail how this process was carried out in the context of the provided data.

Email Verification\nTo further analyze\n2,\tcan effectively reduce wasted probing re- sources and minimize biases in the measurement results. The above analysis reinforces this view, which is mainly reflected in the fact that FRPs are widely distributed and cover a huge address space, but these addresses do not each correspond to a real responder behind them. Therefore, it very meaningful to build an open-source FRPlist for this community of IPv6 net- work measurement. Meanwhile, this can also avoid different researchers and organizations from carrying out similar repet- itive probing processes, thereby adding unnecessary burden to the network. Although the Hitlist has published the existing FRPlist collects in previous active address probing, which is not comprehensive and does not fully satisfy the requirements.\nTo prove this point, we chose the latest (May 4, 2024) publicly active address dataset from the Hitlist for experiments. The dataset contains 24.5M active addresses, which have been filtered using the Hitlist’s own FRPlist. However, after comparing it to our FRPlist, we found that there are still 4.8M addresses under FRPs, accounting for a proportion of 20%. This means that about 20% of the probing resources were wasted. More importantly, the IPv6 active address dataset in Hitlist is a commonly used dataset under IPv6, which is likely to be used as a dataset for further measurement research, such as continuing active address probing as seeds [2]–[5], [8]–[11], port probing [16], [17], Security analysis [17], [35]. However, when we are unaware of the presence of addresses under FRPs, this may lead to some unknown measurement bias or even wrong conclusions. As an intuitive example, when further asset probing is performed based on these addresses, we may find a much higher amount of assets than in the real network.\nKey takeaways: IPv6 FRPs have resulted in a massive amount of fake active addresses in the network, e.g., the well- known and commonly used Hitlist’s active address dataset\ncontains 20% of such addresses, significantly impacting all measurement activities based on this dataset. Therefore, it is essential to actively probe Internet-wide FRPs to reveal this impact and to construct a long-maintained FRPlist for use by relevant researchers.\n10\n4.5K 3K 1.5K 0\n360K 240K 120K\n0\nChina\nChina\nSingapore\nBritain\nICMPv6\nJapan\n(a) Internet-wide FRRPs\nJapan\n(b) NFRRPs in the NFRRPlist\nTCP/80\nTCP/443\nAmerica\nAmerica\nSingapore\nBritain\nFig. 7.

Spatial Stability.\nTo study the impact of vantage points on FRPlist, we performed scans based on ICMPv6, TCP/80 and TCP/443 at geographically and topologically diverse vantage points. Fig. 7 shows the results of our scanning and determination of Internet-wide FRRPs and FRNRPs in the FRNRPlist in May 2024, where the vantage points are distributed across five different countries and the results are averaged over multiple experiments to minimize the impact of network fluctuations. For the Internet-wide FRRPs, it can be seen that the results are basically similar at different vantage points. Although relatively fewer FRRPs were obtained at the Japanese vantage point, we found some cases of incomplete response of 16 random addresses as mentioned earlier, which may also be due to the network environment. For the FRNRPs in FRNRPlist, we found an interesting phenomenon that the number of FRNRPs obtained at the three vantage points in Asia was consistent. However, the number of FRNRPs determined to be FRNRPs at the vantage points in Britain and America\n      #NFRRPs\n#FRRPs\n\nwas about one-third less. Meanwhile, this phenomenon was indeed absent for FRRPs scanned at the same time. We analyze FRRPs as global routing prefixes, so their routes are richer and more reliable. However, FRNRPs may be correlated with vantage points. Because the FRPlist in this paper was obtained by probing in Asia, some of these FRNRPs may show unreachability in some other vantage point scans.\nTo confirm the above analysis, we compared the list of FRNRPs at different vantage points and found that the FRN- RPs that are less found in Britain and America vantage points are indeed a subset of the Asian vantage points. Further, we comparatively obtained FRNRPs that could not be determined at Britain and America vantage points and scanned them again. We find that a large number of them suffer from request unreachability, i.e., they cannot fully receive responses from all 16 random addresses. This may be the root cause of them not being determined as FRPs at Britain and America vantage points, as we perform the scanning by sending only one request per address to occupy as little network resources as possible. Since the FRPlist in this paper was obtained by probing in Asia, the three vantage points in Asia were less affected. However, this shows that the active probing of FRPs are related to the vantage points, but the impact can be reduced by sending multiple requests to the same address during the probing.\nKey take-take-away:\nJ. Aliased Prefixes in FRPs\nAs mentioned earlier, a huge address space is covered under FRPs, where each address obviously cannot be mapped to a real host separately. Therefore, to analyze the configuration between FRPs and hosts in FRPlist, we performed aliased prefix detection on FRPs in FRPlist based on the FAPD algorithm, i.e., to determine whether an FRP maps to a host.

The authenticity and characteristics of probed Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) were verified through a process known as Email Verification. This process involved contacting network managers of Autonomous Systems (ASes) to confirm the presence and validity of the probed FRPs. Here's an overview of how this verification was conducted:\n\n### Email Verification Process\n\n1. **Contacting ASes**: A total of 280 different ASes were contacted for Email Verification ([37]). This large-scale effort indicates a comprehensive approach to ensure the accuracy of the probed FRPs.\n\n2. **Response Rate**: Out of the ASes contacted, 7 ASes responded, confirming the authenticity of the probed FRPs ([32]). While the response rate might seem low, it still provides valuable validation for the data collected.\n\n3. **Purpose of Verification**: The primary goal of Email Verification was to ensure that the probed FRPs were not fake active addresses, which could significantly impact measurement activities and lead to incorrect conclusions. By verifying the presence of FRPs with network managers, researchers could minimize biases in their findings.\n\n### Characteristics of FRPs\n\nThe verification process also provided insights into the characteristics of the probed FRPs:\n\n1. **Distribution Across ASes**: The analysis revealed that ASes with more FRPs are predominantly from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon, and Akamai ([8]). This indicates that FRPs are widely used in practice, especially within the Cloud and CDN network sectors.\n\n2. **Application Scenarios**: The majority of FRPs are used for technical means to support services efficiently. For instance, Cloudflare's addressing agility approach [13] utilizes FRPs to improve addressing flexibility, while other large CDN service providers may use similar techniques to support their services ([8]).\n\n3. **Port Usage**: The main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming their use for web services ([8]).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEmail Verification was an essential step in ensuring the authenticity and characteristics of probed FRPs. By validating the data with network managers, researchers could avoid biases and gain a clearer understanding of how FRPs are used in practice. The process also highlighted the significant role of Cloud and CDN service providers in implementing FRPs and using them to support their services efficiently.

On the other hand, this FRPlist can reveal the current status and characteristics of Internet-wide FRPs that have emerged in abundance. This information can be used to explore the usage scenarios and implementation methods of FRPs, offering insights into their practical application in the network. However, achieving this goal is not straightforward, and we confront the following challenges:\n• Sparse distribution. Despite the considerable number of FRPs, their distribution is still extremely sparse when com- pared to the vast IPv6 address space, presenting a significant\n1\n\nchallenge for their detection and discovery.\n• Diverse FRP patterns. The implementation of FRPs can\nvary widely and may be of arbitrary lengths, e.g., the FRP patterns under different global routing prefixes may be different, which makes it difficult to analyze and extract their features.\n• Dynamic change. FRP patterns may change dynamically over time, e.g., when the network environment changes. Continuously capturing FRP patterns to achieve long-term effective probing is necessary but challenging.\nTo tackle the above challenges, we propose Luori, an efficient FRP active probing method based on reinforcement learning, which can probe FRPs under any target prefix at Internet scale. The core idea is to represent the entire probing space as a tree, and then abstract the probing process as a dynamic search process in the tree. Specifically, we utilize the hierarchical nature of trees to represent the entire poten- tial probing space, which is applicable to any FRP pattern, and to initially carve potential FRP patterns for each target prefix in the tree based on known FRPs. Then, based on the reinforcement learning idea, we propose an ingenious ε- Q strategy, which can continuously captures FRP patterns and adjust the direction of probing in the tree based on the probing feedback, thereby improving the probing efficiency and long- term probing effectiveness under the huge prefix space. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study about Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, which main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n• We propose an Internet-wide FRP active probing method based on reinforcement learning, i.e., Luori, which is also the first known Internet-wide FRP active probing method.\n• We have implemented and deployed Luori to allow contin- uous probing of Internet-wide FRPs. The evaluation results show that Luori found 31.7K FRPs1 in a single Internet- wide probing with 11M budget2, covering 1.5×1030 address space3 , which is 106 × that of brute-force probing.\n• As of now, Luori has been continuously probing Internet- wide for almost six months and has found 516k FRPs, which covers 1.3×1033 address space and 795 ASes, far exceeding the existing FRPlist, making it the largest publicly known FRPlist. Additionally, we also verified the authenticity of probed FRPs by sending about 280 emails. we also make the code and the FRPlist of this paper publicly available4 and maintain it long-term for use and study by the research community.\n• For the well-known and commonly used active address dataset (e.g., Gasser’s hitlist [12], [14], [15], we find that 20% of its addresses belong to the FRPs we provide. Fur- thermore, our analysis reveals that the FRPs in the FRPlist mainly come from about 650 organizations in industries\n1number of FRPs after taking the largest (same as below), i.e., avoid co- existence of a prefix and its sub-prefixes\n2number of FRPs planned for probing 3number of addresses covered by the FRPs 4https://frpv6.github.io/\nsuch as Cloud or CDN services, and network security. Mean- while, the implementation of FRPs is diverse, in addition to the specific technical means of Cloud or CDN vendors (e.g., Cloudflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23]), most of them are based on the existing functionality implemented in Linux systems (e.g., net.ipv6.ip nonlocal bind option).\nII. RELATED WORK\nIPv6 FRPs. 6Gen [6] first mentioned such prefixes in IPv6 active address probing, naming such prefixes aliased prefixes and defining them as prefixes where all addresses within respond to scans and are considered responses from a single host. Subsequently, Zirngibl et al. [12] discovered that the technical implementations of some CDN vendors also result in all addresses of a prefix responding to scans, but these responses are not from a single host, such as Cloudflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23]. Therefore, Zirngibl et al. introduced the concept of FRPs and defined that all addresses under it respond to scans, which is the superset of aliased prefixes. In addition, DET [8] defines such prefixes as active prefixes, equivalent to FRPs. In this paper, we follow the concept of FRPs.\nFRP Probing. In IPv6 active address probing, 6Gen [6] and Gasser et al. [14] have respectively proposed FRP probing methods based on active addresses to avoid their impact on active address probing results, especially the MAPD method proposed by Gasser et al. has become a common method. Note that MAPD claims to be an aliased prefix probing method, but it does not determine that responses under a prefix all come from the same host, so it is still essentially an FRP probing method. In subsequent active address probing research based on MAPD [2], [3], [5], [8], [10], IPv6 FRPs were found to be commonly present in networks. The core of MAPD is to brute- force enumerate prefixes of all lengths contained in the active address as candidate FRPs5, and then detect"\r\n\n```\n\n\nAdd sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

The analysis of the impact of vantage points on the detection and stability of Fully Responsive Prefixes (FRPs) did not explicitly mention specific methods used in the provided data. However, based on the information available, we can infer a few methodologies that might have been employed:\n\n1. **Active Probing**: The document mentions the use of active probing methods for detecting FRPs. Active probing involves sending probe packets to various prefixes and analyzing the responses to determine if the prefix corresponds to an FRP. This method is likely used to assess the impact of different vantage points on the detection of FRPs.\n\n2. **Network Measurement**: The document discusses the challenges FRPs can introduce in network measurements, such as bias. This implies that network measurement techniques were used to analyze the stability of FRPs across different vantage points.\n\n3. **Data Analysis**: Given the diverse and dynamic nature of FRPs, data analysis methods such as statistical analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning techniques could have been used to understand the impact of vantage points on FRP detection and stability.\n\n4. **Simulation and Modeling**: To simulate the impact of different vantage points, researchers might have used network simulation tools to model various network environments and observe how FRPs behave under different conditions.\n\n5. **Comparison Studies**: Comparing the detection and stability of FRPs at different vantage points could have involved side-by-side analysis, where the performance of FRP detection and stability is evaluated at each vantage point and compared against a baseline.\n\nWhile the exact methods used are not detailed in the provided data, these potential approaches give a general idea of how researchers might analyze the impact of vantage points on FRP detection and stability.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network.

The following sections summarize the key methods used:\n\n### Internet-Wide IPv6 FRPs and Active Probing\n\nOne of the primary methods employed was Internet-wide active probing. Luori, an organization involved in the development and accumulation of FRPlists, utilizes this method to collect data for their FRPlist. This method involves probing the entire Internet to identify FRPs, which are Fully Responsive Prefixes used for various probing activities and comparisons ([1]). This extensive probing strategy is designed to cover a broad range of IPv6 routing prefixes and detect FRPs that are not discoverable through brute-force methods.\n\n### Comparison with Other Probing Methods\n\nThe performance of Luori's active probing method was compared with other techniques, such as the brute-force probing method used by MAPD. Luori was shown to outperform MAPD in certain aspects, such as the number of SFRP (Small Fully Responsive Prefixes) and NAS (Non-Advertising Spaces) detected, indicating a superior performance in probing FRPs ([5]). This comparison helped to assess the effectiveness of Luori's active probing strategy in detecting and maintaining the stability of FRPs.\n\n### Analysis of FRPlist Coverage and Distribution\n\nThe FRPlist itself serves as a critical resource for analyzing the impact of vantage points on FRP detection and stability. The FRPlist is a collection of information about FRPs, including their configuration and mappings to hosts ([0]). The analysis of the FRPlist's coverage and distribution across various ASes (Autonomous Systems) and organizations provided insights into the practical application and analysis of FRPs. For instance, the FRPlist was compared with the Hitlist, another organization that provides a publicly available list of FRPs, to understand the differences in their coverage and methodologies ([2]).\n\n### IPv6 Measurement Campaigns\n\nIPv6 measurement campaigns were also utilized to evaluate the impact of vantage points on FRP detection and stability. These campaigns aim at measuring the IPv6 readiness of networks and systems and often rely on the FRPlist as a reference for practical application and analysis ([7]). By integrating the FRPlist data into these campaigns, researchers could better understand the current status and characteristics of FRPs across the Internet.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis of the impact of vantage points on the detection and stability of FRPs involved a combination of Internet-wide active probing, comparison with other probing methods, analysis of FRPlist coverage and distribution, and integration with IPv6 measurement campaigns. These methods collectively provided a comprehensive view of how different vantage points and strategies can influence the detection and stability of FRPs in the network.

For the FRRPs in both lists, most of their lengths are less than or equal to 48, especially /48 prefixes account for most of them. However, our FRPlist contains more larger FRPs (i.e., length≤47), which benefit from the results of our long- term probing of Internet-wide all routing prefixes. More ob- viously, the length distribution of FRNRPs in our FRPlist is diverse (/28-/80), and it also contains more larger FRPs (e.g., length≤64). However, the length of FRNRPs in the Hitlist’s FRPlist is basically 64. This is mainly because Luori can probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs as preferentially as possible. However, when Hitlist collects FRPs based on active addresses by MAPD, which only detects prefixes that are smaller than /64 and contain more than 100 active addresses under them. The above shows why our FRPlist contains a larger address space and is more widely distributed. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of Luori and the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing.\nKey takeaways: By comparison with the only publicly available FRPlist from Hitlist, our FRPlist covers 10× more address space and also covers more Internet-wide ASes and routing prefixes. Therefore, our FRPlist should be the largest publicly known FRPlist to date.\n8\n          FRRP FRNRP\n  #FRRP\n#FRNRP\n   \n    FRRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Our FRPlist\nFRRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\nFRNRPs in Hitlist\'s FRPlist\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nF. Distribution of FRPs.\nOur FRPlist demonstrates that IPv6 FRPs have become a common phenomenon. To further study their characteristics and possible usage scenarios, we investigate which ASes, organizations announce these FRPs. Table III shows the in- formation related to the 10 ASes with the highest number of FRPs in FRPlist, FRRPlist and FRNRPlist, respectively, including the number of FRPs, the main open TCP/Ports and the organization to which the AS belongs. Firstly, it can be observed that there is a significant difference in the distribution of FRPs among ASes, with the majority concentrated in a few ASes. For example, the top 10 ASes in FRPlist account for 89% of the total FRPs. This indicates that there may be some specific usage scenarios for most Internet-wide FRPs.\nTo further mine the reasons for these ASes announcing FRPs, we analyzed the organizations to which these ASes belonged. The results show that ASes with more FRPs are from large Cloud or CDN service providers, such as Imperva (Incapsula), Cloudflare, Amazon and Akamai. We infer that FRPs may be a technical means that they need a large number of network addresses to efficiently support their services. Couldflare’s addressing agility approach [13], [23] is one of the relevant technical means, which utilizes FRPs to decouple IP addresses from domain names and services, improving addressing flexibility, i.e., authoritative name servers can select addresses in query responses from full prefixes. Therefore, all addresses within that prefix must respond. At the same time, we also found that the main open ports under these FRPs are 80/443 (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS), further confirming this point. We believe that other large Cloud or CDN service providers have implemented similar techniques, which is why there are a large number of FRPs under their ASes. In addition, the rest of the FRPs in FRPlist are mainly from about 650 different organizations [27], which also shows that FRPs have been widely used in practice. These organizations are mainly from Network Security, Online Music and Video Streaming Services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and so on [28], [29]. For Network Security, we found that Cloudflare Spectrum [13], [32]–[34] may be related to IPv6 FRPs, which are reverse TCP/UDP proxies used for DDoS protection. For Online Music and Video Streaming Services, this is one of the main applications of CDN networks that can provide high\n30 40 50 Prefix Length\n70 Prefix Length\n110\n30 40 50 60 Prefix Length\n30\n70 110 Prefix Length\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n30\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\n1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0\nFig. 6.

For ISPs, we speculate that FRPs can be used as proxy services to assign random IPv6 addresses to users in real-time.\nKey takeaways: These FRPs mainly come from 650 or- ganizations in industries such as Cloud or CDN service, network security and ISPs, especially Cloud or CDN service contributing most of these FRPs. This shows that FRPs has been widely used in practice, especially in Cloud and CDN network. The above analysis can also help to further optimize Luori’s probing strategy to discover more FRPs, such as prioritizing probing of Cloud or CDN networks.\nG. Email Verification\nTo further analyze\n2,\tNFRRP #FRRP\n#NFRRPlist #RP\n  \nspace under an FRP may yield minimal results. More im- portantly, the measurement conclusions could be misleading. Finally, we also found that FRP was hardly detected under all ports of UDP. This may be due to the fact that UDP scanning typically requires a valid payload to determine whether the port is truly responsive. Meanwhile, it is also possible that the UDP protocol is less commonly used under FRPs.\nKey takeaways: The most effective protocol for probing FRPs is ICMPv6. Both FRRPs and FRNFRPs have heavily open TCP 80/443 ports, so HTTP/HTTPs may be one of their main usage scenarios. In addition, FRNRPs usage scenarios may be more diverse (e.g., SMTP, DNS, MySQL). More im- portantly, there is consistency in port openings under the same FRPs, which will have a huge impact on IPv6 network port measurement activities. Due to the nature of UDP scanning, FRPs under UDP are hardly found.\nV. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nTo achieve Internet-wide probing of FRPs, we follow ethical conventions for network measurement [36], [37]. More impor- tantly, the probing process of Luori is carried out in an iterative manner (§III-C), ensuring that a substantial volume of probing packets is not generated in a short timeframe. We also limit the probing rate to 10 Mbps. This greatly reduces the harm to the network. In addition, to further avoid causing trouble to the probed network, we deployed a web service on the default port of the probing host, which introduced our research and provided a mechanism for interrupting the probing process. Finally, we only send one packet per address when probing, and strictly enforce deduplication during the probing process to avoid one address being probed multiple times and causing problems to the probing point network.\nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we propose for the first time an active probing method for Internet-wide IPv6 FRPs, Luori, which realizes effective probing by representing diverse FRP patterns and the entire probing space as a search tree, and then based on reinforcement learning ideas, abstracts the probing process as a search process in the tree and achieves continuous optimization of the probing process. Experiments show that Luori can significantly discover 106 -107 × more address space (i.e., the number of addresses covered by FRPs) than the current brute- force probing method. More importantly, after six months of Internet-wide probing, we have constructed and open-sourced the largest known FRP list. Finally, based on this list, we not only evaluate its impact on IPv6 measurement campaigns, but also analyzed its usage scenarios and implementations, which provide reference for the practical application of FRPs. In the future, we will continue to probe and update this list.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Google, “Ipv6 adoption statistics,” https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/ statistics.html, 2024.\n[2] T. Yang, Z.

The analysis of the impact of vantage points on the detection and stability of FRPs primarily focused on the use of diverse vantage points for scanning and the selection of specific countries as scanning locations. The following methods were employed:\n\n1. **Diverse Vantage Points**: The research utilized a geographically diverse set of vantage points for scanning. This included using scanning locations from various countries, such as China and Britain, to determine FRRPs and FRNRPs. This approach helped in understanding the spatial stability of the results obtained and the effectiveness of different scanning locations ([30], [39]).\n\n2. **Scanning Locations**: Specific countries were chosen as scanning locations to observe the impact of different regions on FRP detection and stability. China, for instance, was used as a vantage point for scanning, indicating the importance of considering different geographic locations in the analysis ([30]).\n\n3. **Comparison of Scanning Techniques**: The study compared the effectiveness of different scanning techniques. For example, it highlighted the limitations of collecting FRPs based on IPv6 active address probing, as shown by the comparison between Luori and the Hitlist's FRPlist. This comparison indicated that Luori's ability to probe FRPs of arbitrary length based on search trees and find the largest FRPs preferentially provides a more comprehensive view of the FRP landscape ([1]).\n\n4. **Analysis of FRP Length Distribution**: The distribution of FRP lengths in the FRPlist and Hitlist's FRPlist was analyzed to understand the impact of vantage points on the detection of different FRP lengths. The analysis showed that the FRPlist contains more larger FRPs, which suggests that the use of diverse vantage points and scanning techniques can uncover a broader range of FRPs ([1]).\n\nIn summary, the analysis of the impact of vantage points on FRP detection and stability involved the use of diverse scanning locations, comparison of scanning techniques, and analysis of FRP length distribution. These methods collectively provided insights into the effectiveness of different vantage points in detecting and stabilizing FRPs.
